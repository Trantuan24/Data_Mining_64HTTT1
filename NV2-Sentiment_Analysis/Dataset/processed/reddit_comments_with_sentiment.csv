iPhone,technology,1jydl8a,More Chaos: Trump Admin Signals New Tariffs on Electronics from China After Pause,mmynpol,"I voted for Kamala but would she truly have been much better? The DNC didn’t even give voters an option. She stood for nothing and we would have had another 4 years of status quo—legislators pandering to donors, government spending with workers footing the bill, and a widening wealth gap. The DNC passed spending bills which allocated billions to tech companies and Biden signed off on it. Chips act. 

The system is broken. Both the Democrat and Republican parties obtain the majority of their funding from billionaire donors, corporations, private equity, banks, and hedge funds. Then they sponsor bills, written by the donors, which allocated billions via spending/stimulus bills back to those corporations. They spend a few million to receive billions. 

This is primarily funded by income tax. Not billionaires who derive their rather on appreciation of assets rather than income. At most they pay 20% which is absurdly low compared to max income tax rate of 38%. In reality they don’t even pay that because they have a myriad of loopholes and tax avoidant strategies which have been incorporated to our tax code. 

Corporate tax rates cap at 20% but again they have a myriad of tax avoidant strategies at their disposal. Like Apple setting up a shell company in Ireland (tax-free country) that they pay a royalty to on every iPhone, lowering their effective tax bill. 

At least with Tariffs, corporations would pay something. And I’m well aware of the argument that they will just pass cost that price onto the consumer. In reality they can only pass so much cost onto the consumer before consumers refuse to purchase it. Basic economics. Those corporations end up paying much of the tax. The counter-narrative is total propaganda cooked up by those entities to avoid paying their fair share. If you and I can pay taxes—so can corporations. 

Especially since those corporations are massive beneficiaries of government spending. 

The reality, unfortunately, is that Trump will likely pander to major corporations and only small businesses will get screwed.

You can track this progress by looking at MicroLED or other display technologies. Mainstream mixed reality will aim for 16K@240Hz per eye and extremely fast eye tracking (like what's possible with event camera eye trackers) for foveated rendering. You also need an opacity filter to blend the real light with virtual light which allows the creation of shadows. (Such technology does not exist currently without blocking a lot of light). For reference, current timelines have such displays and optics into the 2040s as no company is willing to invest billions into new foundries.

Realize that there are so many pieces to a mainstream headset that companies like Meta, Apple, and MS can't just sit back and wait for hardware. The OS and software library side of things is something that'll take companies decades to refine. Also these headsets require sophisticated SOC setups with ASICs which requires investment and partnerships.

I've written about this before, but I suspect we'll see [SPAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode) event cameras with very advanced ASIC chips for processing later. They'll be able to do very low-powered eye/hand/pose tracking and scene understanding. (With variable rate sampling to scan very high quality on demand). Such hardware though has to go through miniaturization which is easily still 15 years off also. That said, Canon/Sony/Samsung could produce such hardware for everyone so it's not exactly something individual companies need to worry about unless they want it early.

Also it's said a lot in these discussions, but AR, like cellphones, will destroy whole industries. Future mainstream glasses don't just change cellphones, but it replaces everything with a display. Your TVs, projectors, monitors (tablets, laptop screens), etc probably don't exist in the future. You can argue about timelines for this, but this is what companies are looking at.

When I complained to corporate they gave me no sort of apology and did not even see this as an issue. I was young and dumb so did not make nearly as big of a deal out of this as I should have. 

But I have never and will never step foot inside one again, I will go hungry over eating there, I have literally sat out in the car as others have gone in to eat when it was the only open option. 

Once a company is on my shit list they will never get a single cent from me, for Samsung I will even avoid products that contain Samsung parts. I will also do everything in my power to make sure no one I know gives them money.

The reason I can say what I say comes down to a few things.

* There is zero controversy in stating that OLED technology is better than any LCD technology.  If you need the modest brightness advantage of QLED for a room with glare and whatnot, all that means you are trading out image quality and viewing angles for brightness (and unsolicited dithering, since there are almost no LCD TVs that don't use it).

* WOLED is right out, because luminance overshoot is a dealbreaker, and after half a decade+, they still haven't eliminated it, so it's evidently not going away.  Quite bluntly, there's an alternative panel type which just so happens to not have that issue, while also being brighter as a nice bonus.

* Sony are the only real contenders here with their A95 series which are effectively just Sony's branded iteration of Samsung's display.  But for whatever reason, Samsung consistently edges Sony out on color reproduction/accuracy, HDR gradients and (probably the most obvious) gray uniformity, which actually translates to how much array artifacting you can see in sub-5 nits scenarios—probably the only meaningful artifact QD-OLED has.  Sony also _never supports Freesync,_ like WTF!?  You pay a premium for the Sony tax but then have to put up with missing conveniences like that because, one supposes, Sony's engineering team lives by the philosophy that a minority utility means it can be excluded outright.  But I will give the A95 series the one W in that it at least supports Dolby Vision.

As for the question of

* The vast majority of the minor difference in raw color accuracy can be almost completely sorted out via the TV's comprehensive non-service menu color tweaks.  A professional calibration is _not_ necessary for that.  It's actually a near certainty that most of it is solved simply by setting the TV's color scheme to ""Warm 2"" which is a Samsung user tradition.  Like Rtings noted, if you simply measure the TV out of the box, it's going to be a little too blue.  All Samsungs do this, including QLEDs.
* Again, _provided you care about color like you say,_ the difference in color gamut representation between the two models is vastly more important.  Do you want HDR or not?  I'm honestly surprised you brought up color at all.  Incidentally, if this is a sincere concern of yours, I strongly recommend an A/B at a brick and mortar so you can see for yourself.

> Like, do you think there's an objectively best car? An objectively best house? An objectively best plane?

Strawmen.  And maybe that's been your issue all along.  You have possibly internalized a false equivalency.  There can be and have been objectively best cameras, best CPUs, best GPUs etc.  Maybe I can even help you with this.  If you can't find a website whose goal is to compare competing products in a category and figure out which ones do their jobs better, whereupon they determine specimens that stand out as being head and shoulders above their competition, then consider it disqualified.  ""Cars"" for example is too broad and you'd never find an absolute winner—although you perhaps could have in the early 20th century.  ""EVs"" on the other hand could definitely someday find a clear winner.",Fredasa,1,1742816816.0,2436,423,423,[],"> Really, my whole point is that what you are claiming as ""important objective qualities"" are an infinitesimal subset of things people actually care about when buying a TV. So how can you possibly claim one TV is ""best""?

Because 1: when you find a consumer who _does_ understand what they are buying and wants to get their hands on the best, your concern here is invalidated, and 2: if your minority was truly of little consequence then the likes of Rtings would be out of jobs—instead, a million people have depended on them to sort out the good from the bad.

This isn't really new. The reason this hasn't been commercialized has always been cost and scale. The article doesn't really talk about the technology but presumably they made some improvements to the manufacturing process. It is just another incremental step. Nobody has found an easy way to place millions of LEDs in a way that is cost effective enough consumers could afford it, yet.

Sony has shown earlier versions of this. I believe it was called Crystal LED and was shown at CES. Samsung similarly has been showing ""The Wall"" microLED TV for years. 

Believe it or not this tech has been around even longer than that. The massive displays you see in stadiums? Direct RGB LEDs just like this. It has just been prohibitively expensive to scale for general consumers. The way in which the image is generated is actually much simpler than LCD.

This is also the same thing as microLED technology by some definitions. I like that they aren't using the term microLED because there are actually 2 very different types of display that have both been called ""microLED"" and it gets confusing. They are differentiated by their manufacturing process. This display and Samsung's ""The Wall"" (marketed as ""microLED"") transfer millions of microLEDs from a wafer and spread them out over the display. Apple was also working on microLED displays for their devices (sadly no longer) and their tech would also fall under this first category. The second type of microLED display (which I personally think should retain the ""microLED"" name) leaves the microLEDs tightly packed on the wafer and directly bonds them to a backplane. This second type of microLED is for very tiny displays (even smaller than a watch) that will likely be used in future AR glasses. 

There is no official definition of how small the LED has to be before it is called a ""microLED"". Even relatively small microLEDs only a few microns wide are plenty bright for a TV. The main thing that dictates the microLED size in these large format displays is cost, not performance. Bigger LEDs use more material and thus cost more. There are some papers out there that estimate based on cost even large TVs like this will probably need to use microLEDs about 10 microns wide (or less) to be meet the bottom line.

Performance wise it will beat (or tie) LCD and OLED in just about every way. Brightness, contrast, efficiency, lifetime, viewing angle, refresh rate etc will all be better.

iPhone,gadgets,1iuihb1,"Apple, Lenovo lead losers in laptop repairability analysis",me60q0d,"From the component-level repair perspective, Lenovo is a piece of garbage.

1. Some devices use internally programmed USB-C controllers. If you don’t have the firmware, you can’t flash a clean one to fix a very basic charging circuit repair, which is easy on most PC laptops and all Macs.

2. Modern devices tend to use Lenovo ThinkEngine as an SIO chip, which means if it dies, you need to find a donor to fix it.

3. **WORST shit.** They have been using low-temp solder for a few years now, with a melting point of around 138°C. It is fragile as shit—it dies if the mainboard bends (it fucking bends as you type on the keyboard or grab the laptop by a corner). This leads to all sorts of ripped BGA issues—memory, CPU, SIO, and inrush MOSFETs literally soldering themselves off the board (which has become a signature problem on certain Lenovo devices).

4. **Even worse shit.** **Compound.**

Because of point 3, Lenovo decided to glue chips onto the board with an extremely hard adhesive. It’s way tougher than on iPhones, Macs, or even automotive devices. On newer devices, it hardens further when heated. This makes trivial repairs **extremely** difficult. Some adhesive variants are thermally unstable, which means: you solder a GDDR chip near the GPU, keep everything around it as cool as possible, but remember the 138°C solder? You finish the job, and now the chips around it need reballing too because the solder popped out from the compound.

Removing chips on some devices is extremely challenging. I have a **Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 9** here, which just needs a simple SIO reballing (it only turns on if you press on the chip, which is a 100% easy fix on any device except Lenovo). Most likely, I will have to **drill it away**, since pulling it under heat would likely damage the PCB and rip off lots of pads. So instead of a 30-minute job (including disassembly), it becomes a **“hard case”** simply because of its manufacturing design.

I happen to know someone who has access to Lenovo’s internal remanufacturing kitchen—Lenovo themselves **have no adhesive removal method**. If they need to remove a CPU from a board, they **CNC-drill it away**.

The watch form factor has many advantages over a badge.  
You can wear a watch even when naked, and don't need to worry about transferring it to new outfits. There is enough space for a screen to show text/images and scroll through lists. It's firmly attached to your wrist, you can get away with a bit more weight than something flapping around on your shirt. Since it has direct contact to skin, it can monitor biometrics such as heart rate. Watches are already normalised in society, so people don't really notice smartwatches.

I guess there is nothing stopping you mounting a smart watch as a badge. 

IMO, the only advantage the badge form factor has over a watch form factor is that you can put a camera on it, and that camera will see roughly what you can see.   

Though the general public seems to get really weirded out by people wearing cameras, it's continually killed any attempt at the smart glasses form factor.  I suspect humane went with the badge form factor as an attempted end-run around this general distrust, as people are much less likely to notice something chest mounted.

iPhone,android,1juhcae,Exclusive: Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold Gets a Price Cut as Pixel 10 Prices Climb,mm24j8n,">Surprisingly, the Pixel Fold model will actually drop in price by the time we get to 2028. It’s expected to be priced around $1,500 in 2028. However, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to drop to around $1,600.

>The Pixel Fold will also decrease in price again in 2027, bringing it to around $1,500.

So far this reads like ""speculation"" based on ""trust me bro I have a source."" Uncertainty about the veracity of the source aside, pricing strategy changes on a monthly or even weekly basis. There is no way to know for certain how they'll price these phones until the moment they actually release it. Companies are known to change pricing of products down to the last minute.

>We’re told by a source familiar with the situation that Google is going to be increasing the price of the Pixel 10 Pro XL (notably not the Pixel 10 Pro). We’re expecting it go up by around $100, which would bring the Pixel 10 Pro XL to $1200 and add a larger gap between the three phones (four phones if you count the Pixel Fold). 

As noted in the article, I wonder if they're also doing the iPhone 15/16 Pro Max thing, where they eliminate the base 128GB version and the $1200 one starts at 256GB of storage. Otherwise I see few reasons to go with an XL over the base.

>Update: This article previously noted that the Pixel 9 was $699 and going up to $799 for Pixel 10. That’s incorrect, Pixel 10 will remain at $799.

This puts further doubt on the validity of their claims in my lens. While they were quick to edit their mistake, it shows that they didn't double check their numbers before publishing. The Pixel 9 has been out for more than half a year and its higher $799 price tag over the Pixel 8 at $699 has been extensively discussed. At minimum the author is unfamiliar with the Pixel lineup.

We are expecting it go up by around $100, which would bring the Pixel 10 Pro XL to $1200 and add a larger gap between the three phones (four phones if you count the Pixel Fold). 

As noted in the article, I wonder if they are also doing the iPhone 15/16 Pro Max thing, where they eliminate the base 128GB version and the $1200 one starts at 256GB of storage. Otherwise I see few reasons to go with an XL over the base.

>Update: This article previously noted that the Pixel 9 was $699 and going up to $799 for Pixel 10. That is incorrect, Pixel 10 will remain at $799.

This puts further doubt on the validity of their claims in my lens. While they were quick to edit their mistake, it shows that they did not double check their numbers before publishing. The Pixel 9 has been out for more than half a year and its higher $799 price tag over the Pixel 8 at $699 has been extensively discussed. At minimum the author is unfamiliar with the Pixel lineup.

iPhone 14-16 (price based on size of phone): $139 -$159)

Licensing costs,Certification costs, Dev costs, materials, labor etc.

They could also keep it short and just say our target was a 40% profit margin on each unit.

With my 2 year replacement cycle it is kind of a non starter. I agree it should cost more than a premium case but $70-80 tops.

I won't have to buy a case so subtract \~$20 but that is still \~$70 a year to have a keyboard (with my replacement cycle).

I give it a C+ for addressing the pricing complaints. They listed some sources that drive up the cost (mostly just saying quality) but I would want to hear more numbers.

Flashlight seems to have been fixed since 18.3, but the fact that it even made it into production is laughable.

Control centre customisation has been a joke since launch, with 18.4 I had a completely blank, non functional button added to my control centre that after expanding said 'visual intelligence', I could no longer move it around and the button still did not do anything when pressed.

Starting at $599, the iPhone 16e was released by Apple in March to replace the iPhone SE, the most affordable device in the company's lineup.

>Samsung followed in second place with 18% market share, continuing its gradual decline from 21% in Q1 2023. The Korean manufacturer experienced a slow start due to the late launch of its S25 series, but saw sales improve in March.

Meanwhile, vivo and OPPO rounded out the top five.

Basically, to improve email/notification summarization without collecting users’ actual emails, Apple does something like this:
	•	They generate a random email and a few (say 5) variations of it.
	•	They compute embeddings for each variation (a high-level representation LLMs can understand).
	•	Then, from iPhones with analytics enabled, they randomly pick a percentage.
	•	These devices receive the embeddings and compare them to the user’s last 20 received emails by calculating which variation is closest.
	•	Each iPhone adds noise to its answer (e.g., if the closest match is version 1, it might send back 1, or maybe 2 or 4), and sends that noisy result to Apple.
	•	With enough noisy responses from many devices, Apple can statistically recover which variation was most similar overall — say, version 3.
	•	That version is then added to their training data (or reused in another round to refine results).

The latter is the core problem and why you'll basically never get a real / actual pc operating system on the ipad, vision headset, or what have you. Those are all afaik very directly forked off of ios with extremely limited and non-pc-ish capabilities, restrictions, and core API / app concepts.

ipados is terrible, and will continue to remain terrible, because the approach is and will remain / continue to be to just try to reimplement a really, really crappy pseudo-window-server\[1\] + app user interface framework, from scratch, on top of ios / ipados garbage, instead of just porting over the macos window server, macos frameworks, and the full bsd userland etc etc

\[1\] which mind you wouldn't run well at all on *most* ipads (excl the m-series) b/c they don't have anywhere near enough ram.

Plus the ports are terrible / lightning is f---ing godawful, and apple damn well probably / almost certainly isn't ever going to bother to try implementing thunderbolt / 3rd party usable and fully PC (ie mac) compatible PCIe + displayport on their mobile hardware (nevermind the ipads that are literally using mac SOCs lol), so your ability to actually connect those to and do much of anything with most / nearly all ipads anyways is going to be crippled anyways.

It's overall a really dumb / myopic bit of long term strategy + decision making / lack thereof on apple's part, IMO, b/c they in fact *are* and have been extremely well positioned to eg. just build a dockable phone / tablet that *could* run full-blown macos when plugged into literally kbm/monitor thunderbolt setup. Which would yes somewhat cannibalize mac sales but would also give an actual *reason* for people to actually care about and make real use of apple's incremental YoY phone/tablet hardware improvements, and push *relevant* user-facing planned obsolescence forwards by another decade or two, or three. And which would to be clear be massively transformational and useful from basically any and all end user's perspectives. ie why bother having a business laptop to do excel and powerpoints or whatever when your laptop *is* just the phone in your pocket, something to plug it into, and a small breakout thunderbolt 5 hub or whatever. But I digress.

As is I swear to god, xiaomi or huawei is probably going to *somehow* end up doing this at some point or another, *despite not actually having a decent full featured PC OS to work with*, before apple. (samsung has ofc *tried* to do this, repeatedly, but GLHF there)

Also, to be clear.

Clearly Cook is not a “bad CEO”, they have thrived and made a fortune under his tenure. However, just comparing his leadership (and who he promotes/hires/culture/etc), and look back at the pre-iPhone R&D:  
Other companies were working on full touchscreen phones already. But they were working with established touchscreen technologies, and screen technology, which was affordable but had limitations, kind of like the chin bezel we saw for a long time.  
Steve not only focused on hiring creatives, but when they showed him options he knew the value in usability.

I’m not saying for certain that Tim Cook would make different decisions in that scenario, but it certainly seems to me he has a lower bar for “acceptable usability” to release something, and so I think details like that could easily get missed if it were very expensive.

I don’t doubt their assistant fills out a calendar for them, and they probably use Mac Mail app, but not the mobile stuff and not the DETAILS.

What if ***US citizens*** want to buy an iPhone? Oh shit, then they pay tariffs because it is still being imported *from Canada.*

Further, because the iPhone is manufactured in China, it actually gets hit with tariffs twice, making it even more expensive for Americans. CUSMA exemptions only apply to goods that are Canadian in origin. It will get tariffed for the Chinese components, and then tariffed *again* as a Canadian import.

Theres a great book titled 'Corporate Lifecycles: How and Why Corporations Grow and Die and What to Do About It'

The gist is that companies are started by ""founders"" or ""visionaries"" who want to spend 10x money to create 100x value by creating a product that means something and soars the company. And when that product stagnates, and so the company stagnates, and the financials stagnate—they have the creativity to do it again—to create a new product that means something and soars the company—again! And again! And again!

Sound familiar?

Steve Jobs. The Apple II. Then NeXTSTEP which became OS X. Then the iMac G3. Then the Mac laptops. Then the iPod. Then the iPhone. Then the iPad.

But eventually founders get bought out, or run out, or die—and the money people come in and manage those products as long as they can, but if they let it become a money culture where they wear suits and manage by spread sheet—it's only a matter of time. Happens to almost every company, eventually.

Cook managed to bypass this issue by realizing his weakness—he's not a visionary—so he leaned on his team to be the visionaries and be the managers of products—while he focuses on his strengths as CEO which is operations. 

But I think this story shows Cook fucked up and fell back on his instincts to care about operations and money over product—he didn't listen to his product guy. And its a taste of what happens when the top guy isn't a product guy. When the rubber meets the road they look down on product guys, don't take them as serious, views them as ""cost.""",78914hj1k487,4,1744428791.0,1704,297,297,[],"When numbers-people talk other numbers-people, its hard to break the trance.

iPhone,apple,1jxdvrk,"Daily Advice Thread - April 12, 2025",mmu7aq3,"Hey all—I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would love some input. I just bought an iPhone 16 Pro (256GB) while on a trip to Hawaii, so I at least got the ~5% sales tax savings. But now with all the news about Apple being exempt (for now) from the new tariffs, and rumors heating up about the iPhone 17 Pro being a major leap… I’m wondering if I should return it and just tough it out with my 13 Pro until September.

From what I’ve seen, the 17 Pro could feature:
	•	A full redesign (possibly a horizontal camera bar)
	•	All 48MP rear cameras + 24MP front camera
	•	A19 Pro chip with 12GB RAM
	•	More advanced on-device AI features with iOS 18
	•	Possible vapor chamber cooling and bigger battery

I’m still within the return window, and my 13 Pro is holding up fine—not amazing, but fine. My biggest concern is whether the tariff exemption will stick, or if prices could spike by the time the 17 drops (especially since most iPhones are still assembled in China). I’m also a bit tempted by the 16 Pro’s lighter feel and camera bump improvements, but I know I’ll probably get FOMO when the next one hits.

What would you do in my shoes? Return the 16 Pro now and wait it out, or keep it and skip the 17?

Apple apparently weighed up multiple options for the backend of ‌Apple Intelligence‌. One initial idea was to build both small and large language models, dubbed ""Mini Mouse"" and ""Mighty Mouse,"" to run locally on iPhones and in the cloud, respectively. ‌Siri‌'s leadership then decided to go in a different direction and build a single large language model to handle all requests via the cloud, before a series of further technical pivots. The indecision and repeated changes in direction reportedly frustrated engineers and prompted some members of staff to leave Apple.

In addition to Apple's deeply ingrained stance on privacy, conflicting personalities within Apple contributed to the problems. More than half a dozen former employees who worked in Apple's AI and machine-learning group told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution, citing an overly relaxed culture, as well as a lack of ambition and appetite for taking risks when designing future versions of ‌Siri‌.

Apple's AI/ML group has been dubbed ""AIMLess"" internally, while employees are said to refer to ‌Siri‌ as a ""hot potato"" that is continually passed between different teams with no significant improvements. There were also conflicts about higher pay, faster promotions, longer vacations, and shorter days for colleagues in the AI group.",chrisdh79,1425,1744296293.0,1588,234,234,[],"From the article: A new report from [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-fumbled-siris-ai-makeover)(Soft Paywall) today reveals much of the internal turmoil behind Apple Intelligence's revamped version of Siri.

Smartphones existed before iPhone, but the iPhone was so well designed it set the standard for the smartphone platform. Same with the iPod--no one made an mp3 player that had an incredibly user friendly design before Apple.

That doesn't matter. It was a common opinion as I said. In fact, people were so convinced that they ignored a decade-plus of ""desktop OSes don't work well with touchscreens"" arguments against macOS on the iPad and went straight to Mac apps on the *finger-driven* headset. 

>Even if it ran MacOS, it would still be powered by their slowest chip. That's not going to replace all of their Macs for professional use.

No, a headset does not need to run (only) a regular M-series chip. You can just put a fast processor in a separate box that connects to the headset. Every Apple product that uses something higher than a regular chip is either a desktop or a relatively large laptop, so you're not giving up portability. 

Also, saying that the headset can be a Mac replacement does not imply that the headset can replace every single Mac for every single task (otherwise almost nothing could be a replacement of anything). For example, desktop replacement laptops lack the performance of the highest-end desktops, but are still called replacements. 

>Not by anyone intelligent. Do I need to explain how the two aren't similar at all?

Let me explain to you why they are similar. 

Both smartphones and glasses have the potential to replace several existing products with a single device that is as portable as each individual product. 

That's why people thought glasses would be the next smartphone.

Apple iPhone 16 family lineup
According to BofA analysts led by Wamsi Mohan, shifting iPhone assembly to America is technically possible, however it would dramatically increase production expenses and create logistical complications.

""iPhone cost can increase 25% purely on higher labor cost in the U.S.,"" the analysts wrote in a note to clients. They explained that even if Apple finds domestic workers for final assembly, a ""significant portion"" of iPhone components would still need to be manufactured in China and imported to the States.

Assuming Apple faces reciprocal tariffs on those imported components, the total manufacturing cost could rise by 90% or more, the analysts estimated.

The analysis follows statements from President Trump earlier this week calling Apple's manufacturing in China ""unsustainable."" According to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Trump ""absolutely"" believes Apple could manufacture iPhones in the United States. During a recent media briefing, Leavitt said the President believes ""we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.""

Trump's aggressive trade policies singled out China on Wednesday, pausing reciprocal tariffs on 185 countries for 90 days but increasing duties on Chinese imports to 125%. In response, China has imposed 84% retaliatory levies on American goods. It's becoming increasingly difficult to assess where the stand-off goes from here.

Uncertainty caused by the trade war has battered Apple's stock, which has fallen 14% since Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, erasing approximately $479 billion in market capitalization.

iPhone,apple,1jvzjzu,How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover,mmeauty,"Summary from [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/)


A new report from The Information today reveals much of the internal turmoil behind Apple Intelligence's revamped version of Siri.

Apple apparently weighed up multiple options for the backend of ‌Apple Intelligence‌. One initial idea was to build both small and large language models, dubbed ""Mini Mouse"" and ""Mighty Mouse,"" to run locally on iPhones and in the cloud, respectively. ‌Siri‌'s leadership then decided to go in a different direction and build a single large language model to handle all requests via the cloud, before a series of further technical pivots. The indecision and repeated changes in direction reportedly frustrated engineers and prompted some members of staff to leave Apple.

In addition to Apple's deeply ingrained stance on privacy, conflicting personalities within Apple contributed to the problems. More than half a dozen former employees who worked in Apple's AI and machine-learning group told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution, citing an overly relaxed culture, as well as a lack of ambition and appetite for taking risks when designing future versions of ‌Siri‌.

Apple's AI/ML group has been dubbed ""AIMLess"" internally, while employees are said to refer to ‌Siri‌ as a ""hot potato"" that is continually passed between different teams with no significant improvements. There were also conflicts about higher pay, faster promotions, longer vacations, and shorter days for colleagues in the AI group.

Apple AI chief John Giannandrea was apparently confident he could fix ‌Siri‌ with the right training data and better web-scraping for answers to general knowledge questions. Senior leaders didn't respond with a sense of urgency to the debut of ChatGPT in 2022; Giannandrea told employees that he didn't believe chatbots like ChatGPT added much value for users.

In 2023, Apple managers told engineers that they were forbidden from including models from other companies in final Apple products and could only use them to benchmark against their own models, but Apple's own models ""didn't perform nearly as well as OpenAI's technology.""

Meanwhile, ‌Siri‌ leader Robby Walker focused on ""small wins"" such as reducing wait times for ‌Siri‌ responses. One of Walker's pet projects was removing the ""hey"" from the ""hey ‌Siri‌"" voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took over two years to achieve. He also shot down an effort from a team of engineers to use LLMs to give ‌Siri‌ more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress.

Apple started a project codenamed ""Link"" to develop voice commands to control apps and complete tasks for the Vision Pro, with plans to allow users to navigate the web and resize windows with voice alone, as well as support commands from multiple people in a shared virtual space to collaborate. Most of these features were dropped because of the ‌Siri‌ team's inability to achieve them.

The report claims that the demo of ‌Apple Intelligence‌'s most impressive features at WWDC 2024, such as where ‌Siri‌ accesses a user's emails to find real-time flight data and provides a reminder about lunch plans using messages and plots a route in maps, was effectively fictitious. The demo apparently came as a surprise to members of the ‌Siri‌ team, who had never seen working versions of the capabilities.

The only feature from the WWDC demonstration that was activated on test devices was ‌Apple Intelligence‌'s pulsing, colorful ribbon around the edge of the display. The decision to showcase an artificial demonstration was a major departure from Apple's past behavior, where it would only show features and products at its events that were already working on test devices and that its marketing team had approved to ensure they could be released on schedule.

Some Apple employees are said to be optimistic that Craig Federighi and Mike Rockwell can turn ‌Siri‌ around. Federighi has apparently instructed ‌Siri‌ engineers to do ""whatever it takes to build the best AI features,"" even if that means using open-source models from other companies in its software products as opposed to Apple's own models.",Snoop8ball,107,1744296598.0,4263,670,670,[],"Summary from [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/)

iPhone,apple,1jvzjzu,How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover,mmr2qp0,"How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover

Last month, Apple shook up the leadership of Siri and announced an embarrassing delay in new AI-powered features for the assistant. A behind-the-scenes look at the effort shows just how dysfunctional it got.

——

Last June, at Apple’s annual developers conference, the company offered a dazzling demonstration of how artificial intelligence could supercharge Siri, the iPhone’s virtual assistant. But behind the scenes and in the months that followed, the Siri team couldn’t make up its mind about the basic technology needed to make it all work.

One option they considered was to build small and large language models, which they dubbed Mini Mouse and Mighty Mouse, according to a former Apple employee familiar with the effort. The small model would run on a user’s iPhone and handle simple tasks, such as setting an alarm using Siri. The large model would run in the cloud and perform more-complex chores, like automatically booking an Uber to get an iPhone user to their next meeting.

Then Siri’s leaders decided to go in a different direction and build one large model that could handle everything. That would have required running Siri’s software in the cloud, a reversal of an earlier approach when most of Siri’s software was moved on device for privacy. Other significant technical pivots followed, frustrating Siri staffers and prompting some to leave Apple. That put its goal of releasing the new Siri features this year in jeopardy.

-- The Takeaway
Apple’s decision to delay the release of new AI features in Siri came after the team behind the personal assistant struggled with technical and leadership challenges.

The indecision was among the factors contributing to Apple’s stunning announcement last month that it was, in fact, delaying the release of the new Siri features until 2026. Inside Apple, the company told staff it was also stripping responsibility for Siri from its AI chief, John Giannandrea, and his lieutenant, Robby Walker, who oversaw day-to-day operations, according to four people familiar with the matter.

In their place, Apple said its head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, would oversee Siri, with Mike Rockwell, the Apple executive who previously led development of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, handling Walker’s former responsibilities, according to three of those people. (Bloomberg first reported the changes.)

The delay was an embarrassing setback for Apple in AI, just nine months after it had reassured investors at its developer conference that it had a plan to get its act together in AI with the Siri upgrades and other features. While Apple has long faced criticism about the plodding pace of innovation in Siri, those concerns have intensified in recent years with the explosion in popularity of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other AI products.

iPhone,apple,1jvzjzu,How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover,mmr3cyt,"— Siri’s Problems

Siri’s issues started years before its recent struggles.

In 2018, when Giannandrea arrived from Google to run the newly formed AI group, his hiring was seen by the tech industry as a coup for Apple. While some executives thought Giannandrea would be more interested in overseeing the company’s self-driving–car project—which it has since shelved—he took a special interest in Siri, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

At the time, Siri, which Apple had released as a feature on iPhones in 2011, had begun to stagnate. It struggled to answer general knowledge questions and offered limited support for third-party apps.

Even before Giannandrea took control of the assistant, members of the group working on Siri felt like second-class citizens at Apple. Siri engineers were frustrated by the software engineering team’s control over iOS updates, feeling that they weren’t prioritizing fixes for Siri, according to former Apple employees with direct knowledge of the matter. The software engineers, for their part, felt the Siri team couldn’t keep up with supporting new features that came out of Federighi’s group.

Giannandrea told others he was confident he could fix Siri by adopting the playbook Google had followed to build its own AI-powered voice assistant. He believed Apple simply needed the right training data and had to get better at scraping answers from the web to answer general knowledge questions, according to a person who spoke to him about it.

In some ways, Giannandrea stood out among his colleagues at Apple. Those who have worked with him describe him as relaxed, quiet and nonconfrontational—a contrast to many other members of Apple’s executive team, some of whom were known for their demanding, type A personalities.

Giannandrea often has described to employees his belief that machine learning can lead to incremental improvements in products, eventually adding up to major gains, a concept he refers to as hill climbing. He also has expressed a dim view of chatbots in the past, telling Apple employees before and immediately after the release of ChatGPT that he didn’t believe they added much value for users.

After he joined, some of his colleagues told Giannandrea he should shake up Siri’s leadership, but he didn’t do so, according to former Apple employees who worked in the AI group.

One Siri leader often criticized by colleagues was Walker, who joined Apple in 2013 and became responsible for its daily operations at the end of 2022. In the eyes of his critics, Walker was unwilling to take big risks on Siri and focused on metrics that didn’t move the needle much on its performance, rather than having a grand vision for overhauling the voice assistant.

For instance, he often celebrated small wins such as reducing by minute percentages the delay between when someone asked Siri a question and when it responded, former Apple engineers said. Another pet Walker project was removing the “hey” from the “hey Siri” voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took more than two years to accomplish, they said.

And last year, Walker dismissed an effort by a team of engineers to use LLMs to give Siri more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress, said a person with direct knowledge.

Walker told colleagues he wanted to focus on the next release of Siri rather than commit resources to the project. Without his knowledge, the project’s engineers bypassed him to continue working on those capabilities with the software engineering group’s safety and location team.

— Higher Pay, Faster Promotions

Over time, relations between Federighi’s software engineering group and Giannandrea’s AI team have gotten increasingly tense—and at times downright dysfunctional.

Stylistically, the two executives couldn’t be more different. Federighi’s tough and demanding management style contrasts with Giannandrea’s laid-back approach. When they are in meetings together, Federighi is known to bombard his colleagues with questions, while Giannandrea tends to do more listening, according to people who have been in meetings with them.

Other resentments also built up. Some in the software engineering group were annoyed by the higher pay and faster promotions their colleagues in the AI group were receiving. And they were bitter that some engineers in the AI group seemed to be able to take longer vacations and leave early on Fridays, while they faced more-punishing work schedules.

Distrust between the two groups got so bad that earlier this year one of Giannandrea’s deputies asked engineers to extensively document the development of a joint project so that if it failed, Federighi’s group couldn’t scapegoat the AI team.

It didn’t help the relations between the groups when Federighi began amassing his own team of hundreds of machine-learning engineers that goes by the name Intelligent Systems and is run by one of Federighi’s top deputies, Sebastien Marineau-Mes.

Over the years, Intelligent Systems has trained its own models and built demos that enabled users to control apps with voice commands, often without help from the Siri team. That created tensions with the Siri group. In one internal Apple presentation, a member of Intelligent Systems showed a slide depicting an animation of two mountains smashed together and flattened, which some saw as a subtle dig at Giannandrea’s hill-climbing philosophy, according to two people with direct knowledge.

Around 2022, the Intelligent Systems team began working with Walker and Rockwell, the executive in charge of Vision Pro, on a project code-named Link that soon went south, said four former Apple employees with direct knowledge of the project. The goal of the effort was to develop voice commands to control apps and complete tasks for the mixed reality headset and future augmented reality glasses.

Engineers who attended meetings on the three-way collaboration were struck by the open hostility of Rockwell and Marineau-Mes toward Walker, the day-to-day Siri leader. The two frequently voiced their frustration with Walker over Siri’s slow progress in supporting the Vision Pro.

For example, Rockwell wanted to allow people wearing the headset to use Siri to navigate the web and resize windows with just their voices. He also wanted two people communicating with each other in a virtual space to be able to interact with Siri together so they could, say, plan a joint vacation.

But some members of the Siri team were doubtful the team could achieve that goal. Eventually, many of the Siri features Rockwell envisioned for the Vision Pro were pared back because of the Siri team’s inability to achieve them, the people said.",biru93,1,1744474121.0,6734,1076,1076,[],"— Siri’s Problems

Even before Giannandrea took control of the assistant, members of the group working on Siri felt like second-class citizens at Apple. Siri engineers were frustrated by the software engineering team’s control over iOS updates, feeling that they were not prioritizing fixes for Siri, according to former Apple employees with direct knowledge of the matter. The software engineers, for their part, felt the Siri team could not keep up with supporting new features that came out of Federighi’s group.

Giannandrea told others he was confident he could fix Siri by adopting the playbook Google had followed to build its own AI-powered voice assistant. He believed Apple simply needed the right training data and had to get better at scraping answers from the web to answer general knowledge questions, according to a person who spoke to him about it.

In some ways, Giannandrea stood out among his colleagues at Apple. Those who have worked with him describe him as relaxed, quiet and nonconfrontational—a contrast to many other members of Apple’s executive team, some of whom were known for their demanding, type A personalities.

Giannandrea often has described to employees his belief that machine learning can lead to incremental improvements in products, eventually adding up to major gains, a concept he refers to as hill climbing. He also has expressed a dim view of chatbots in the past, telling Apple employees before and immediately after the release of ChatGPT that he did not believe they added much value for users.

After he joined, some of his colleagues told Giannandrea he should shake up Siri’s leadership, but he did not do so, according to former Apple employees who worked in the AI group.

One Siri leader often criticized by colleagues was Walker, who joined Apple in 2013 and became responsible for its daily operations at the end of 2022. In the eyes of his critics, Walker was unwilling to take big risks on Siri and focused on metrics that did not move the needle much on its performance, rather than having a grand vision for overhauling the voice assistant.

For instance, he often celebrated small wins such as reducing by minute percentages the delay between when someone asked Siri a question and when it responded, former Apple engineers said. Another pet Walker project was removing the “hey” from the “hey Siri” voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took more than two years to accomplish, they said.

And last year, Walker dismissed an effort by a team of engineers to use LLMs to give Siri more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress, said a person with direct knowledge.

Walker told colleagues he wanted to focus on the next release of Siri rather than commit resources to the project. Without his knowledge, the project’s engineers bypassed him to continue working on those capabilities with the software engineering group’s safety and location team.

— Higher Pay, Faster Promotions

Over time, relations between Federighi’s software engineering group and Giannandrea’s AI team have gotten increasingly tense—and at times downright dysfunctional.

Stylistically, the two executives could not be more different. Federighi’s tough and demanding management style contrasts with Giannandrea’s laid-back approach. When they are in meetings together, Federighi is known to bombard his colleagues with questions, while Giannandrea tends to do more listening, according to people who have been in meetings with them.

Other resentments also built up. Some in the software engineering group were annoyed by the higher pay and faster promotions their colleagues in the AI group were receiving. And they were bitter that some engineers in the AI group seemed to be able to take longer vacations and leave early on Fridays, while they faced more-punishing work schedules.

Distrust between the two groups got so bad that earlier this year one of Giannandrea’s deputies asked engineers to extensively document the development of a joint project so that if it failed, Federighi’s group could not scapegoat the AI team.

It did not help the relations between the groups when Federighi began amassing his own team of hundreds of machine-learning engineers that goes by the name Intelligent Systems and is run by one of Federighi’s top deputies, Sebastien Marineau-Mes.

Over the years, Intelligent Systems has trained its own models and built demos that enabled users to control apps with voice commands, often without help from the Siri team. That created tensions with the Siri group. In one internal Apple presentation, a member of Intelligent Systems showed a slide depicting an animation of two mountains smashed together and flattened, which some saw as a subtle dig at Giannandrea’s hill-climbing philosophy, according to two people with direct knowledge.

Around 2022, the Intelligent Systems team began working with Walker and Rockwell, the executive in charge of Vision Pro, on a project code-named Link that soon went south, said four former Apple employees with direct knowledge of the project. The goal of the effort was to develop voice commands to control apps and complete tasks for the mixed reality headset and future augmented reality glasses.

Engineers who attended meetings on the three-way collaboration were struck by the open hostility of Rockwell and Marineau-Mes toward Walker, the day-to-day Siri leader. The two frequently voiced their frustration with Walker over Siri’s slow progress in supporting the Vision Pro.

For example, Rockwell wanted to allow people wearing the headset to use Siri to navigate the web and resize windows with just their voices. He also wanted two people communicating with each other in a virtual space to be able to interact with Siri together so they could, say, plan a joint vacation.

But some members of the Siri team were doubtful the team could achieve that goal. Eventually, many of the Siri features Rockwell envisioned for the Vision Pro were pared back because of the Siri team’s inability to achieve them, the people said.",[],siri problem siri issue started year recent struggle <NUM> giannandrea arrived google run newly formed group hiring seen tech industry coup apple executive thought giannandrea would interested overseeing company self driving car project since shelved took special interest siri according person direct knowledge matter time siri apple released feature iphones <NUM> begun stagnate struggled answer general knowledge question offered limited support third party apps even giannandrea took control assistant member group working siri felt like second class citizen apple siri engineer frustrated software engineering team control update feeling not_prioritizing fix siri according former apple employee direct knowledge matter software engineer part felt siri team could not_keep supporting new feature came federighi group giannandrea told others confident could fix siri adopting playbook google followed build powered voice assistant believed apple simply needed right training data get better scraping answer web answer general knowledge question according person spoke way giannandrea stood among colleague apple worked describe relaxed quiet nonconfrontational contrast many member apple executive team known demanding type personality giannandrea often described employee belief machine learning lead incremental improvement product eventually adding major gain concept refers hill climbing also expressed dim view chatbots past telling apple employee immediately release chatgpt not_believe added much value user joined colleague told giannandrea shake siri leadership not_do according former apple employee worked group one siri leader often criticized colleague walker joined apple <NUM> became responsible daily operation end <NUM> eye critic walker unwilling take big risk siri focused metric not_move needle much performance rather grand vision overhauling voice assistant instance often celebrated small win reducing minute percentage delay someone asked siri question responded former apple engineer said another pet walker project removing hey hey siri voice command used invoke assistant took two year accomplish said last year walker dismissed effort team engineer use llm give siri emotional sensitivity could detect give appropriate response user distress said person direct knowledge walker told colleague wanted focus next release siri rather commit resource project without knowledge project engineer bypassed continue working capability software engineering group safety location team higher pay faster promotion time relation federighi software engineering group giannandrea team gotten increasingly tense time downright dysfunctional stylistically two executive could not_be different federighi tough demanding management style contrast giannandrea laid back approach meeting together federighi known bombard colleague question giannandrea tends listening according people meeting resentment also built software engineering group annoyed higher pay faster promotion colleague group receiving bitter engineer group seemed able take longer vacation leave early friday faced punishing work schedule distrust two group got bad earlier year one giannandrea deputy asked engineer extensively document development joint project failed federighi group could not_scapegoat team not_help relation group federighi began amassing team hundred machine learning engineer name intelligent system run one federighi top deputy sebastien marineau year intelligent system trained model built demo enabled user control apps voice command often without help siri team created tension siri group one internal apple presentation member intelligent system showed slide depicting animation two mountain smashed together flattened saw subtle dig giannandrea hill climbing philosophy according two people direct knowledge around <NUM> intelligent system team began working walker rockwell executive charge vision pro project code named link soon went south said four former apple employee direct knowledge project goal effort develop voice command control apps complete task mixed reality headset future augmented reality glass engineer attended meeting three way collaboration struck open hostility rockwell marineau toward walker day day siri leader two frequently voiced frustration walker siri slow progress supporting vision pro example rockwell wanted allow people wearing headset use siri navigate web resize window voice also wanted two people communicating virtual space able interact siri together could say plan joint vacation member siri team doubtful team could achieve goal eventually many siri feature rockwell envisioned vision pro pared back siri team inability achieve people said,4695,635,0,0,0,6,0.958,positive
iPhone,apple,1jvzjzu,How Apple Fumbled Siri’s AI Makeover,mmr3eie,"— AI Excitement Builds

In November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT to a thunderous response from the tech industry and public. Within Giannandrea’s AI team, however, senior leaders didn’t respond with a sense of urgency, according to former engineers who were on the team at the time.

The reaction was different inside Federighi’s software engineering group. Senior leaders of the Intelligent Systems team immediately began sharing papers about LLMs and openly talking about how they could be used to improve the iPhone, said multiple former Apple employees.

Excitement began to build within the software engineering group after members of the Intelligent Systems team presented demos to Federighi showcasing what could be achieved on iPhones with AI. Using OpenAI’s models, the demos showed how AI could understand content on a user’s phone screen and enable more conversational speech for navigating apps and performing other tasks.

Former Apple employees said executives in the AI and software engineering groups scrambled to claim ownership of new features powered by LLMs. In many cases, software engineering came out on top, thanks to its strong reputation for delivering results.

Despite the company’s experimentation with OpenAI’s models, Apple managers told their engineers in 2023 they couldn’t include models from outside companies in final Apple products and could only use them to benchmark against its in-house models.

Building the large Apple models meant to compete with OpenAI was the responsibility of Giannandrea’s group. However, they didn’t perform nearly as well as OpenAI’s technology, according to multiple former Apple employees who used the models in 2023 and 2024.


— A Dubious Demo

Finally, last June Apple announced a suite of AI-powered features under the umbrella name Apple Intelligence. This suite included writing and image-generation tools, new photo-editing and mail features, and upgrades to Siri. And in a reversal of its opposition to working with AI models made by other companies, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI to offer ChatGPT as an extension for answering questions or performing tasks its own models couldn’t handle.

During an onstage demo at the conference, one Apple executive asked Siri when her mom’s flight would land. The voice assistant accessed her email and real-time flight data to provide the current arrival time. She then asked Siri to remind her about their lunch plans, and the assistant plucked the details from her iPhone’s messages and plotted a route from the airport to the restaurant.

Among members of the Siri team at Apple, though, the demonstration was a surprise. They had never seen working versions of the capabilities, according to a former Apple employee. At the time, the only new feature from the demonstration that was activated for test devices was a pulsing, colorful ribbon that appeared on the edges of the iPhone’s screen when a user invoked Siri, the former employee said.

For Apple, the Siri demo was a break from its past practice. Historically, Apple would only show features and products at its conferences that were already working on test devices and that its marketing team had vetted to ensure they could be released on time.

Still, the event impressed outsiders. Apple’s shares shot up more than 10% in the two days after announcement of the features, as Wall Street showed relief that the company had come up with an AI plan.

Some former Apple employees said they’re optimistic that Federighi and Rockwell can turn things around for Siri, given that they are typically more hands-on than Giannandrea and Walker, who have tended to rely more on their direct reports to manage things.

Federighi, for one, often knows more technical details about software projects than the junior engineers working on them. Rockwell, who joined Apple in 2015, is seen within the company as a leader with vision, who can bring fresh thinking to projects while skillfully navigating the corporate culture.

Federighi has already shaken things up. In a departure from previous policy, he has instructed Siri’s machine-learning engineers to do whatever it takes to build the best AI features, even if it means using open-source models from other companies in its software products as opposed to Apple’s own models, according to a person familiar with the matter.",biru93,2,1744474135.0,4355,692,692,[],"— AI Excitement Builds

They don't have to be unfolded, there is a display on both sides, so it functions as a regular phone when not unfolded. I've seen past versions and had no interest but I was shocked how good the Samsung ZFold 6 was when I saw one the other day, it did not feel bulky at all. That said, I have no idea what battery life is like on them, I would imagine it takes a big hit.

iPhone,apple,1jveetv,Teen iPhone Ownership Continues to Soar,mmbr19i,"Ah yeah, I've heard of Graphene! Definitely sounds like a wise plan to me.

My take on Android vs iOS is very long and specific lol but, as someone who has had an iPhone for 99% of the time I've had a smartphone (I upgraded to an HTC One M8 around a decade ago, but then switched back to iPhone within a week; my secondary Android phone I have now, I've only had for about a month), I'd say the highlights are: 

- iOS just feels much smoother/more polished than Android - there are tiny little animations or designs that I see all over Android that just make me feel like I'm using an OS from 12 years ago. 

- I don't really trust any big tech company with privacy, but Apple is definitely among the ones I ""trust"" the most - with Google being down among the ones I trust the least. 

- I'm pretty deep into the Apple ecosystem - Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Music, iMessage, iCloud Passwords, iCloud storage, Find My, etc. Sure, there's viable alternatives to all of those, but moving sounds like a hassle unless I get a VERY good reason (and there's no fully viable alternative, because part of the convenience is that the same account syncs ALL those parts of the ecosystem with each other)

- Apple is pretty reliable and predictable - I generally know what I'm getting from them, in a way I don't feel for Google or ESPECIALLY the other Android OEMs (looking at you, Samsung).

I have my frustrations with iOS (particularly around how locked down it still is, especially now that the jailbreaking scene is effectively dead), but its overall better reliability and feel still puts it above Android for me. I've also never had an issue finding apps that I want personally; the only example I can think of recently was a torrent client, though it ultimately wasn't that important as I was planning on transferring what I wanted to download to my computer anyways.

I mean, I guess that is your honest experience, but I cannot say that I have experienced anything like that haha, I also just customise my phone to hell and back so it may be that, but even then, at the start, I didnt have any issues with my samsung

>I don't really trust any big tech company with privacy, but Apple is definitely among the ones I ""trust"" the most - with Google being down among the ones I trust the least.

now this is a big no no for me, I dont trust google the company, but I do trust their phones cuz they are VERY open about their phones, and google pixels rather surprisingly are probably the most secure/privacy focused stock android phone compared to the likes of samsung etc etc! i dont know why google is like this, but yh, trust google pixels over apple any day

Fair enough, the ecosystem is rather important and android is just not there, because well, we are kinda decentralised opensource project, google just is the lead but yh, having to co-ordinate android and windows is hard, but for me, as a linux user, I dont have those problems (i started selfhosting and using alternatives, like having a storage server at home from an old iMac (ironic) that i use to store back ups, pictures etc etc, passwords are done by proton (privacy focused company) spotify etc etc, ecosystem is the big lacking part of android for sure, 100% apple for this one!

>Apple is pretty reliable and predictable - I generally know what I'm getting from them, in a way I don't feel for Google or ESPECIALLY the other Android OEMs (looking at you, Samsung).

this is interesting to me, having parents who have iPhones, and seeing stuff online, latest iOS/macos stuff has shown to be buggy or something? weird little stuff for sure, dont know enough to sway one way or the other.

I guess it is both down to a bit of personal preference and muscle memory/experience, using one or the other for a long time is gonna have you be more in favour of the one u use, although I dont hate iOS at all, (based in part on BSD, which is nice) I have a problem with locked down OS's that wont let me do the things I want it to do you know? my phone for me is more than just a tool to use, I like more control and so for me, android is king.

again no hate to iphone, I just cant find myself using it, I also find the UI a little inconsistent, and so I have to have my parents control the phone whilst I tell them what to do (when they ask me for help lolz 😂😂)

iPhone,apple,1jv47gk,Apple Dethroned by Microsoft As Top-Valued Company Amid Tariff Fears,mm75lmd,"From the article: Apple has lost its position as the world's most valuable public company to Microsoft following a dramatic four-day slide in its stock price, driven largely by concerns over President Donald Trump's escalating tariff war with China, where most of its iPhones are assembled.

Apple's market capitalization fell to $2.59 trillion as of Tuesday's close, while Microsoft now sits at $2.64 trillion, reclaiming the top spot after briefly holding it earlier this year.

Apple shares have plummeted approximately 23% over just four trading sessions, shaving $700 billion off its value, as panicked investors dump stock due to the company's exposure to China for manufacturing and sales. Apple relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing for its flagship products, making it especially vulnerable to Trump's aggressive tariff policies.

The broader market has been shaken by Trump's announcement of substantial tariffs on imports from more than 100 countries, with the Nasdaq dropping 13% over the same four-day period. However, Apple's decline has outpaced other tech companies due to its particular vulnerability to U.S.-China trade tensions.

UBS analysts have predicted that the price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max could increase by as much as $350 in the United States as a result of the tariffs. The potential price hike raises questions about how consumers might respond to significantly more expensive Apple products.

Apple has been exploring manufacturing diversification in countries like India and Vietnam in recent years, but analysts suggest it would be nearly impossible for the company to quickly shift its complex supply chain away from China. That's despite President Trump saying he ""absolutely"" believes that Apple could manufacture its iPhones and other devices in the United States. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously said that China's manufacturing expertise and scale are unmatched globally.

Both Apple and Microsoft, along with chipmaker Nvidia, had recently achieved market valuations exceeding $3 trillion before the current market turbulence began.

Microsoft appears somewhat insulated from the worst effects of the tariffs, with Jefferies analysts recently including the company among those they view as better positioned to weather the current uncertainty.

The two tech giants have traded the ""most valuable company"" title several times in recent years, with Microsoft claiming the top spot in early 2024 before Apple regained it – only to lose it again during this week's market volatility.

According to one report, Apple earlier this week urgently requested suppliers to ship as many premium devices as possible to the U.S. by air freight before Trump's falsely-described ""reciprocal"" tariffs of 104% on China came into effect Wednesday. China has since retaliated by slapping 84% tariffs on U.S. goods.",chrisdh79,20,1744200632.0,2838,434,434,[],"From the article: Apple has lost its position as the world's most valuable public company to Microsoft following a dramatic four-day slide in its stock price, driven largely by concerns over President Donald Trump's escalating tariff war with China, where most of its iPhones are assembled.

Stocks go up when people THINK the company is doing well (sure, there are reality driven things like earning calls that affect stock prices, but those are usually ""corrections"" to the perception. People buy stock before the earning calls, before product announcements, etc. based on what they PERCEIVE is going to happen, then correct if their perception is changed by reality).

To your point about Apple, I'd say they are equal parts hardware and software at this point. But if we're picking one to say what they are ""at heart"", I'd actually say they are, at their heart, a software company. Remember there was a small period of time where they licensed Mac OS to run on non-Apple made hardware, which if they were a hardware company at heart, they likely wouldn't have done. Most of their stuff around hardware has been because they realized to create the best software, you have to tightly control the hardware.

Drivers are probably the number one cause of issues on Windows. Drivers exist because you can't bake the hardware/software interaction layers into the OS if your OS needs to be able to support third party devices. If you only support specific hardware, you don't really need to support drivers. (I'm simplifying this a lot, I know there's a lot packed into ""hardware/software interaction layers"", but the details are irrelevant to the point). Prior to designing their own hardware, they would just select specific hardware from other companies and only support that hardware and bake those things into their OS.

The reason Apple is hit harder by this is because of this exact perception that you stated. Both Microsoft and Apple are hardware and software companies (Microsoft has Azure cloud hardware, Surface line of products, Xbox, even things like Holo Lens and stuff). But when people thing of Microsoft, they think of Windows and Office. Mostly the software. When people think of Apple, they think of iPhone and Mac. Mostly the hardware.

So if tariffs are going to affect your stock price, the company that people think of the hardware first is the company that is going to be hit hardest, even if Apple at it's heart is a software company.

Because of the Azure hardware infrastructure, and the surface line, and the Xbox, Microsoft is likely to be hit REALLY hard by the tariffs as well (one could argue even harder as the impact will be less up-front, meaning people are less likely to associate cost increases with tariffs and get pissed at Microsoft instead of who is actually to blame).

Most Americans making $70k cannot truly afford that. Newbies will wait for the Indonesian one to be $350 on a Black Friday special that probably includes a shitty amp.

Reality is, the vast majority of Americans cannot afford to buy American. That iPhone at $2700 or a $20 t-shirt for $54 does not get as many takers. ",[],ole world <QUESTION> guitar story fender make iconic stratocaster electric guitar corona california ensenada mexico ngoro indonesia plain jane american strat start <NUM> tariff mexican one <NUM> <NUM> indonesian one <NUM> unless landed record deal sony maybe snl next week <EXCLAMATION> playing <NUM> year not_going drop <NUM> guitar american making <NUM> cannot truly afford newbie wait indonesian one <NUM> black friday special probably includes shitty amp reality vast majority american cannot afford buy american iphone <NUM> <NUM> shirt <NUM> not_get many taker,566,82,1,1,0,1,-0.5583,negative

Americans certainly *say* they want manufacturing jobs re-shored, and have voted accordingly in two of the last three elections.

They also say they want jobs that don’t require a four year degree, and hand-wave about “trades”, etc.

But then if you talk to people in skilled labor  they have trouble finding qualified people to meet demand - and it’s harder as the skill set required gets more refined. So maybe carpenters are a little easier to find, but we don’t have nearly enough people going into HVAC install and repair.

In this instance re: China and iPhones, Apple (at least Cook) has been open about the fact that China doesn’t only have this market of high-precision electronics manufacturing cornered because of low wages *but because of the skill set required*. And when you look into other work that is done in the states, like machinists, you’ll find them saying basically the same thing: that younger people are not going in to these fields and that we cannot support the needs of production with the labor force we have.

And so my question is, what the hell is going on here?

It feels to me that it’s obvious that a lot of the talk about blue collar jobs in the US is just bullshit.

Yes, but tariffs are going to end up increasing prices globally, although primarily the impact will be on this country.

>At least people who live close the Canadian or Mexican border can just drive over the border and get the regular prices one.

Yes, but legally you'll be subject to a duty.  The first $800 would be exempt. If you're traveling with family it could be up to $3,200 if pooled together. The duty is also only 3% for the next $1,000 after that (after that it gets tricky based on classification).

So a $1,800 iPhone would have no duty if you pooled it with spouse/family, or if by yourself, it would only be a $30 duty.

I am a mini zealot. I have rode the original iPhone SE in the recycled 5s casing into the sunset until the 12 mini came out. I now have the 13 mini, I have a spare unopened 13 mini. I have tried & mildly enjoyed bigger phones for ""premium features"" and eventually moved back to the mini because nothing since the 12/13 minis release has really felt like a gotta have. Maybe usb-c but im willing to live without that for the form factor.

The clamshell fold isn't it for me. I've held and played with the android ones.

Can't speak for all mini enjoyers but the allure of the mini for me and where the advent of the 12mini finally moved small phone into fully-capable phone territory is the blend of convenient utility with all the bells and whistles. The convenience for me is absolutely derived from the size of the phone, it's one I enjoy using and brings me joy. It's one where if I want to i can still watch youtube vids n stuff but generally even the biggest phone sucks at this experience, and I just use my desktop or tv to watch stuff. Like the biggest phone screen is still a tiny portable screen that is way smaller than an ipad screen and that's just not very great for any media consumption. I don't see the difference between an iphone mini and a maytag refrigerator sized iphone 42069 giga pro max in terms of a media consumption experience at all, it feels the same to me (its a small screen that fits in your pocket). When people say bigger screen for watching stuff, it's just not a justification that resonates with me and I've tried all the phone sizes. 

Pocketability, surprisingly, isn't the biggest thing i care about with iphone sizes. They are all sized to fit inside someones pocket. With that said, the clam fold phones just don't offer anything special to me I actually think their pocketability sucks. More importantly there's just no way they're going to provide a ""mini"" form factor when opened, and in a folded state it's really not going to be small. In it's folded state, the proper phone resolutions sort of just warrant a device that turns into a square brick that is just an awkward size with double thickness when folded.They'll for big/regular phone sizes once open. So unless they make something with the current iphone mini dimensions when open, i probably wont care too much. 

And if im gonna commit to jumping ship to a big phone knowing that, give me the book mode.

I am a mini zealot. I have rode the original iPhone SE in the recycled 5s casing into the sunset until the 12 mini came out. I now have the 13 mini, I have a spare unopened 13 mini. I have tried & mildly enjoyed bigger phones for ""premium features"" and eventually moved back to the mini because nothing since the 12/13 minis release has really felt like a got to have. Maybe usb-c but i am willing to live without that for the form factor.

The clamshell fold is not it for me. I have held and played with the android ones.

Cannot speak for all mini enjoyers but the allure of the mini for me and where the advent of the 12mini finally moved small phone into fully-capable phone territory is the blend of convenient utility with all the bells and whistles. The convenience for me is absolutely derived from the size of the phone, it is one I enjoy using and brings me joy. It is one where if I want to i can still watch youtube vids n stuff but generally even the biggest phone sucks at this experience, and I just use my desktop or tv to watch stuff.

In his latest Power On [newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-06/will-apple-raise-iphone-prices-in-the-us-after-trump-tariffs-iphone-17-details), Gurman revealed that Apple is ""considering a delay until 2026"" for the new smart home device. The main reason for the potential postponement is reportedly tied to ""major engineering hiccups"" with the revamped Siri voice assistant that will power the device.

Initially, Apple had hoped to release the product by now, and there were reports suggesting it might still arrive around the time of this year's iPhone 17 series launch in September. Now, those plans appear to be in jeopardy.

""The major engineering hiccups related to the revamped Siri voice assistant ended up delaying the product,"" Gurman wrote. ""No big surprise there: The device will be primarily controlled by voice, and it depends on Siri and the underlying App Intents technology.""

Despite the delay, testing of the device – code-named J490 – continues at Apple headquarters. A large number of employees are also reportedly testing the hub in their homes.

Gurman compared the upcoming product to the Google Nest Hub, suggesting it won't ""make a big difference in terms of revenue"" for Apple. However, he noted that it could set the stage for more ambitious products in the future.

One such future product, code-named J595, is already in development. According to Gurman, this follow-up device will add ""an AI personality, additional sensors and a robotic arm that can maneuver the screen above your desk, kitchen counter or nightstand.""

The delay of Apple's smart home hub ties in with the company's recent announcement that it needs more time to develop the promised more personalized version of Siri, which was previewed at WWDC 2024 last June. Apple stated these features would arrive ""in the coming year,"" suggesting they won't be ready until sometime between iOS 19 in September 2025 and iOS 19.4 in March 2026.",chrisdh79,15,1744022367.0,2152,331,331,[],"From the article: Apple's rumored new smart home hub command center that was expected this year could be delayed, pushing its release all the way to 2026, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

iPhone,apple,1jrgmvl,"iPhones Could Cost Up to $2,300 in the U.S. Due to Tariffs, Analyst Says",mlevzu7,"It's not impossible but it makes a lot of assumptions.

The retail price of a product is not its import value, and products at different price points have different margins.

If you are selling imported widgets for $100 which you buy for $60, a 50% tariff means you pay a $30 tax on each widget.  If you pass that on to consumers, now they pay $130 which is a 30% increase in retail price.  Your profit margin goes down but your earnings (or EPS for a public company) are the same as long as your customers can afford the tariff.

In order to get the worst case outcome that makes for a good headline, here's one way to do it:  Take Apple's net profit margin of 24% assume this applies directly and uniformly to all of its products and that Apple has no other costs globally other than buying products to import.  That would cause you to conclude that an iPhone sold for $1599 cost $1599 * .76 = $1,215.24 to import, then apply a 54% tariff to that and get $656.23, add that to the retail price and get $2255 which is a 41% increase.  Then round that up to $2300 because Apple typically uses prices which are $XX99 in that range.

This is shaky because Apple does have a lot of other costs which are not importing products so the 24% net profit margin does not apply directly to products.  High end iPhones have the highest margins which probably exceed 40% so passing a 54% tariff directly on to customers would be a 21.6% price increase, probably more with rounding.

Another way to argue for a $2300 phone is to assume that Apple's high end customers can easily afford to spend more while its low end customers cannot, and so it will pass on the tariff costs disproportionally to these two groups - increase the high end products by a lot more and don't increase the low end products enough to cover the tariff completely.  This route is more plausible, however it also means that you can't apply the 43% to both the high end AND the low end retail prices which the article does.",Worf_Of_Wall_St,1,1743789974.0,1982,367,367,[],"It is not impossible but it makes a lot of assumptions.

That being said the angle is preposterously disingenuous. iPhones and Mac products objectively have the longest lifespan and support window of their respective markets. 2015 Macbooks are still perfectly fine, whereas almost any 2020 Windows laptop is already cooked beyond repair by now because they are garbage devices upcharged to premium prices. Android phones are offered 2-3yrs of OS support on average, only Google (which has Apple prices) offers a more competitive 5 years. Apple gets significantly more, making it a better purchase for longevity. I have an iPhone 12 mini (2020) and it isn't even on the slate to lose OS updates until 2027.

iPhone,apple,1jqncyn,Apple loses $250bn in market value from Trump tariff hit,ml91059,"> Apple lost more than $250bn in market value on Thursday, making it one of Wall Street’s biggest casualties of Donald Trump’s tariff blitz despite chief executive Tim Cook’s efforts to court the administration.

> Shares in the iPhone maker were down as much as 8.5 per cent as trading opened in New York on Thursday, enough to reduce its market capitalisation from $3.37tn to $3.12tn.

> Trump hit all of Apple’s biggest supplier and manufacturing hubs in Asia, including China, Taiwan, India and Vietnam, with huge new tariffs on goods imported to the US.

> The aggressive move will affect almost every model of iPhone, iPad, Mac and accessory that the tech giant sells.
> The US president’s pledge to “liberate” the economy presents Cook with an unenviable choice between raising prices for its high-end electronics or swallowing the extra costs, which could wipe tens of billions of dollars off the profits that Apple investors have long prized.

> 
> Apple in February pledged to hire 20,000 staff and invest $500bn in the US over the next four years, including a new facility manufacturing servers for artificial intelligence in Texas.

> 
> However, Cook, who risked the ire of Apple staff by attending Trump’s inauguration and visiting the president at the White House, has not so far obtained any exemption from the new tariffs.
> 
> The White House confirmed that there were no carve-outs for Apple in the president’s executive order.
> On Wednesday night, the company declined to comment on whether there was any prospect of it securing an exemption from the levies, as it managed to do during Trump’s first term.
> 
> Apple did not immediately respond to a further request for comment on Thursday.
> 
> Analysts at Citi estimate that the iPhone maker has more than 90 per cent of its manufacturing in China, which is set to face combined tariffs of at least 54 per cent on imports to the US.
> 
> Vietnam and India, which produce a growing number of Apple products including iPhones, AirPods and Watches, face “reciprocal” tariffs of 46 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively.
> 
> However, semiconductors are currently exempt from the new tariffs, which could shield Apple, which is a customer of chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, from a 32 per cent “reciprocal” duty on the island nation.
> 
> TSMC’s new plant in Arizona is believed to account for a large portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars that both Apple and Nvidia have pledged to spend on US production over the coming years.
> 
> However, expanding that plant will probably become more expensive too, given the 20 per cent new tariff on imports from the EU, including from the critical Netherlands-based chip equipment manufacturer ASML.

> Analysts at TD Cowen estimate that US sales account for almost a third of Apple’s total revenues, of which about three-quarters come from hardware products. The iPhone alone makes up almost two-thirds of US hardware revenues, they said.
> 
> 
> “Based on the range of hardware products that Apple sells . . . and the countries that manufacture them, we estimate that every 10 per cent of tariffs would impact net income by 3.5-4 per cent” over the next two years, TD Cowen wrote in a note to clients.

iPhone,apple,1jqh2bj,iPhone 17 Pro: New 48MP Telephoto Lens May Change How Zoom Works,ml6tmhi,"From the article: Apple is reportedly planning a major upgrade to the Telephoto camera in the iPhone 17 Pro, and while it may seem like a step back on paper, the change could actually improve real-world usability, if one leaker's claims are anything to go by.

According to [Majin Bu](https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-pro-revolution-in-mobile-photography-with-advanced-telephoto-lens/), the iPhone 17 Pro will feature a new Telephoto lens with a 48MP sensor, up from the current 12MP sensor found in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. This rumor isn't new – in fact it's been repeatedly claimed by several other sources. However, Bu goes further by claiming that the new lens will offer 3.5x optical zoom (85mm equivalent) instead of the 5x zoom (120mm equivalent) currently available.

This focal length is generally better suited for portraits and everyday photography, since it allows users to frame shots without having to move as far away from the subject. However, the big shift allegedly comes from the new 48MP sensor, in that the extra resolution allows for digital cropping to simulate longer focal lengths, offering less quality loss than normal digital zoom.

This is similar to what Apple already does with the main Fusion camera on the iPhone 16, where the 48MP sensor enables a 2x digital crop – marketed as ""Telephoto"" – that still produces a 12MP image with minimal quality loss.

Bu points out that one of the practical benefits of a 3.5x telephoto lens would be greater versatility, especially for portrait photography. A 3.5x lens would make it easier to compose portraits at more comfortable distances, particularly in indoors or other tight environments.

The alleged change would see Apple relying more on high-resolution sensors and computational processing to replace some of the limitations of traditional optics. If the report is accurate, the iPhone 17 Pro could deliver more flexible zoom options while making portrait photography more user-friendly, without sacrificing image quality.

Given that the iPhone 16 Pro models already have 48MP Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could be the first iPhone models to boast a rear triple-camera array made up entirely of 48-megapixel lenses. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 lineup in September.",chrisdh79,74,1743683199.0,2316,367,367,[],"From the article: Apple is reportedly planning a major upgrade to the Telephoto camera in the iPhone 17 Pro, and while it may seem like a step back on paper, the change could actually improve real-world usability, if one leaker's claims are anything to go by.

However, Bu goes further by claiming that the new lens will offer 3.5x optical zoom (85mm equivalent) instead of the 5x zoom (120mm equivalent) currently available.

This focal length is generally better suited for portraits and everyday photography, since it allows users to frame shots without having to move as far away from the subject. However, the big shift allegedly comes from the new 48MP sensor, in that the extra resolution allows for digital cropping to simulate longer focal lengths, offering less quality loss than normal digital zoom.

This is similar to what Apple already does with the main Fusion camera on the iPhone 16, where the 48MP sensor enables a 2x digital crop – marketed as ""Telephoto"" – that still produces a 12MP image with minimal quality loss.

Bu points out that one of the practical benefits of a 3.5x telephoto lens would be greater versatility, especially for portrait photography. A 3.5x lens would make it easier to compose portraits at more comfortable distances, particularly in indoors or other tight environments.

The alleged change would see Apple relying more on high-resolution sensors and computational processing to replace some of the limitations of traditional optics. If the report is accurate, the iPhone 17 Pro could deliver more flexible zoom options while making portrait photography more user-friendly, without sacrificing image quality.

Given that the iPhone 16 Pro models already have 48MP Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could be the first iPhone models to boast a rear triple-camera array made up entirely of 48-megapixel lenses.

And if we can't physically fit a bigger aperture, I see no reason to give up reach. The longest focal length lens should always be as long as they can manage with the engineering available, because there's no way to substitute that

I mean, why not just put a 50mm lens in and use your digital crop there, if you're fine with a digital crop? It makes much more sense to mess around with the middle lenses and leave the widest and longest lenses alone

The biggest weakness of an iPhone (and the main reason it doesn't replace my ""proper"" camera) is the fact that I'm limited to 50/85/120mm (depending on the exact model) equivalent. Whereas my longest lens gets out to 480mm equivalent (APS-C so it's a 300mm on a 1.6x crop factor sensor)

I'd like to see the iPhone Pro having 4 lenses, personally. Stretch a 4th lens out to 200mm and sure, maybe there's enough wriggle room to pull the 120mm back to 85mm. But making the longest lens shorter is just crazy to me - there's SO much more value in a longer lens rather than tinkering with having to step forward/backwards a couple of steps or having marginally more bokeh while still leaving 90% of it in software.

iPhone,apple,1jptcc1,Apple Hit With $5 Billion Class Action Lawsuit Over eBooks Availability,ml1tujx,">A lawsuit filed against Apple in California this week accuses the company of violating the state's false advertising law and other consumer laws, by intentionally misleading customers into thinking that they are purchasing digital e-books from the Apple Books app in perpetuity, when instead they are only purchasing revokable licenses to the books.

>The proposed class action complaint explains that Apple is required to pull a digital book or audiobook from the Apple Books app if and when it loses a license to that content, resulting in the content no longer being available in the app's store. As a result, the complaint alleges that some customers have unexpectedly found that digital books they previously purchased were no longer available to re-download, despite having paid for them. Apple removes books without warning, and without providing refunds, the complaint adds.

>As noted in the complaint, the purchase screen in the Apple Books app does not include a link to any terms of service or licensing information. However, in order to set up and use an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or other Apple device, users are required to agree to Apple's various software license agreements, which all state the following:

>""By using this software in connection with an Apple Account, or other Apple Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions […]""

>In the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, Apple states the following:

>""Purchased Content will generally remain available for you to download, redownload, or otherwise access from Apple.

Apple officially announced the new feature support for AirPods Max last week. Then on Monday, Apple released an AirPods Max (USB-C) firmware update version 7E99 in tandem with the rollout of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 software updates for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, since then, AirPods Max owners have not been able to successfully update their devices due to an unspecified conflict with the firmware and Apple’s latest software.

The AirPods Max firmware was supposed to enable lossless and low-latency audio support as part of the broader software releases. “With this update, AirPods Max will unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio, preserving the integrity of original recordings and allowing listeners to experience music the way the artist created it in the studio,” said Apple in a press release. “Lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio enable music creators to fully utilize AirPods Max throughout their entire professional workflow on Logic Pro and other music creation apps.”

However, after Apple indicated the firmware was available for download, user reports of problems slowly began to trickle in. As it stands, there’s no sign that anyone has been able to install the firmware.

It’s still not clear what Apple has done in iOS/iPadOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia 15.4 to cause the issue, but all the indications are that Apple will need to release a point update to its platforms to correct the bug.

And when I saw that I could make interest free payments through my TMobile plan, I broke down and bought the Ultra!

Now while I'm not sure this phone is ""worth"" the ~$1,400 it costs post tax with no discount... But I do have to admit, this phone is amazing.

Vivo x200 pro. This is the very first Android phone where it optimize everything itself just like iPhone(Which I truly like about). I don't want spend flagship level money on phones & do this/do that for better, this phone handled perfectly. Like I charge it with every 24 or so. Of which 2-3hr is gaming somewhat, rest camera/social media/music. Gives me around 8hr or so SOT in general l, could go up if I do some settings but idc.

Camera ? This is the best. No kidding, you will notice an huge difference even from iPhone. I won't go into specs much but it defines what actual camera is. Check reviews. Are they any better ? Personal preference of people taste but this phone comes in top camera category along few other.

OS wise, For me it's very clean & smooth. I was in One UI 6 & honestly I don't know what's the hype ?. I don't care about customization much besides choosing my personal wallpaper for appealing. OS provides all functions that I can think of & has not encounterd any issues. So for me, it's really fine.

It also provides 4 yrs of OS support & 5 yrs security. For me it's totally good. Besides 4 yrs seems decent & you can stretch it even beyond until the phones last breath unless you encounterd problems/tempted to buy new phone.

This phone has two versions Chinese with Origin OS & Global with Funtouch OS. People say Chinese version a bit better but honestly after checking everything its only missing few shenanigans here & there & not worth that Chinese bloat ware.

I am talking about the fact that I have encountered bugs, you accuse me of lying and spreading misinformation right away, while you yourself complain about the S23 and have alleged bugs.
That is, you can write badly about the phone and complain about problems, but I don't because I'm already spreading lies xDD

Don't defend̈ the brand so much, because you come off as a hypocrite ;)

Xiaomi used to be profitable as it was cheap then those bugs in the OS could be forgiven, now as the phone costs as much as an iphone or Samsung and the OS is still a hole with bugs then nothing but to laugh about it.

What kind of permissions? Accessibility for example can stop working just like that.

iPhone,smartphones,1jymywj,Thinking of switching to Samsung or Google pixel,mmzxnf6,"I was always an android user and switched to an iPhone 13 pro when it came out. 2 weeks ago I switched back to a pixel. 

Here's my experience, and I'll preface with saying that I don't plan on going back to an iPhone. 

Apps work better on iPhone. It's not androids fault, it's just that it's easier to app developers to focus on iPhone and have half the market covered. There are so many different android phones that it's more work to make sure they're all bug free. That's not to say they don't work, you'll just likely see minor issues here and there on random apps. It doesn't make them unusable, just a little annoying is all. 

iMessage - if it's a big deal to you, get ready. Rcs works great, but it's not iMessage. It's good enough, but still not iMessage. 

Camera - I can't tell a difference. I honestly feel like most cameras are good enough for the average user these days. See mkbhd videos where he does an annual bracket competition thing. Most people can't tell the difference either. 

Airpods & pixel buds - again, airpods are better, but most people can't tell the difference. Maybe if you use them back to back, but it's not like the pixel buds are trash. I'd say the pixel buds are great, and the airpods are really great. 

Find my - again, Apple wins here. I don't know why, I've seen other people explain it. I just know it's not as good. You can now see friends on the android find my app, but it's still not as good as apples. 

Customization - android wins without a doubt. So many different ways to customize things. 

Accessories - again Apple. It's a numbers thing, there are just more iPhones out there than each individual android phone. So less choices for cases and what not. HOWEVER!!!! you have more choices when it comes to things like earbuds, watches, etc. You're notnlocked into the Apple ecosystem, so you can get whatever you like. 

Keyboard - thank God I'll never have to use the iPhone keyboard again! And changing keyboards on iPhone is not the same. They lock down too many features to make them all just about as bad as theirs. 

Android - Screen is better. Bluetooth is better (could just be cause it's newer). Wi-Fi is better (again, maybe just cause it's newer). Love USB c charging speeds. LOVE not being locked into apples ecosystem and their way of doing things. Notifications are better. Settings are better. File management is better. Tethering to a Chromebook is great. Yea, Apple might do some things better than android, but it wasn't enough to stay locked into their way of doing things.

Both should take decent pictures but have inferior hardware compared to flagships from the same brands. In video recording iPhone should win hands down.

Pixel has 120 Hz screen, iPhone is at 60 Hz; some people won't care, dealbreaker for others.

iPhone has much better processor, which combined with the lower refresh rate means it should feel much faster than the Pixel once 4-5 years have elapsed.

The iPhone is smaller, thinner and lighter but it would be best to check out a unit at a store to judge if it's a difference you'd feel day to day. It should also feel more premium, Apple has decades of design experience prior to Google and much higher sales volume, they know how to make a phone feel appealing.

The 9a is also worth checking out, it's an upgrade from the 8a overall, except for it has a smaller camera sensor (but also almost no camera bump) which may impact quality.

Don't forget the biggest differentiator which is OS. Do your research on features you care about and respective availability.

Now you said that phones have OS support of 2 years for low end and 3-5 years on high end phones or flagship ones. This was true before, but now things changed. Some budget phones for example budget Samsung phones went to the 7 years of OS support. iPhone on another hand also have many years of support, for example iPhone 11 still have OS support and it will get next iOS.



Now this root acces is also true, but this is now the case with more or less every device from phones, consoles to the PC. You just can’t go without it. Its just the way it is now and you can chose to go with it or without tech at all.



I agree that all of them have similar look and that there is no creativity any more. But phones went to that point where they are making the product for the mass usage and they are looking to make the device that is for everyone or at least for most users as possible. 


Last thing where i agree is the price. Its true that phones are expensive. Also new ones are coming out every year which is kinda stupid to me because i dont see some changes they can make in one year. They could do it in 2-3 years, but in one there is just not enough time to publish the device that will make me to buy the next one.
