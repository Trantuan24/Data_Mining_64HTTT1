Sure it wasn't going to cause Apple to on-shore iPhone production.  Nothing is going to be able to do that.  Apple doesn't want to charge $3000 for an iPhone made in the U.S.

iPhone,technology,1jydl8a,More Chaos: Trump Admin Signals New Tariffs on Electronics from China After Pause,mmynpol,"I voted for Kamala but would she truly have been much better? The DNC didn‚Äôt even give voters an option. She stood for nothing and we would have had another 4 years of status quo‚Äîlegislators pandering to donors, government spending with workers footing the bill, and a widening wealth gap. The DNC passed spending bills which allocated billions to tech companies and Biden signed off on it. Chips act. 

The system is broken. Both the Democrat and Republican parties obtain the majority of their funding from billionaire donors, corporations, private equity, banks, and hedge funds. Then they sponsor bills, written by the donors, which allocated billions via spending/stimulus bills back to those corporations. They spend a few million to receive billions. 

This is primarily funded by income tax. Not billionaires who derive their rather on appreciation of assets rather than income. At most they pay 20% which is absurdly low compared to max income tax rate of 38%. In reality they don‚Äôt even pay that because they have a myriad of loopholes and tax avoidant strategies which have been incorporated to our tax code. 

Corporate tax rates cap at 20% but again they have a myriad of tax avoidant strategies at their disposal. Like Apple setting up a shell company in Ireland (tax-free country) that they pay a royalty to on every iPhone, lowering their effective tax bill. 

At least with Tariffs, corporations would pay something. And I‚Äôm well aware of the argument that they will just pass cost that price onto the consumer. In reality they can only pass so much cost onto the consumer before consumers refuse to purchase it. Basic economics. Those corporations end up paying much of the tax. The counter-narrative is total propaganda cooked up by those entities to avoid paying their fair share. If you and I can pay taxes‚Äîso can corporations. 

Especially since those corporations are massive beneficiaries of government spending.

iPhone,gadgets,1jz1f4o,"Tim Cook ‚ÄúCares About Nothing Else‚Äù Than Beating Meta In ‚ÄúIndustry-Leading‚Äù Smart Glasses, But True AR Glasses Will Require Time And Technologies To ‚ÄúBe Perfected‚Äù",mn3821t,"> A variety of technologies need to be perfected, including extraordinarily high-resolution displays, a high-performance chip and a tiny battery that could offer hours of power each day.

You can track this progress by looking at MicroLED or other display technologies. Mainstream mixed reality will aim for 16K@240Hz per eye and extremely fast eye tracking (like what's possible with event camera eye trackers) for foveated rendering. You also need an opacity filter to blend the real light with virtual light which allows the creation of shadows. (Such technology does not exist currently without blocking a lot of light). For reference, current timelines have such displays and optics into the 2040s as no company is willing to invest billions into new foundries.

Realize that there are so many pieces to a mainstream headset that companies like Meta, Apple, and MS can't just sit back and wait for hardware. The OS and software library side of things is something that'll take companies decades to refine. Also these headsets require sophisticated SOC setups with ASICs which requires investment and partnerships.

I've written about this before, but I suspect we'll see [SPAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode) event cameras with very advanced ASIC chips for processing later. They'll be able to do very low-powered eye/hand/pose tracking and scene understanding. (With variable rate sampling to scan very high quality on demand). Such hardware though has to go through miniaturization which is easily still 15 years off also. That said, Canon/Sony/Samsung could produce such hardware for everyone so it's not exactly something individual companies need to worry about unless they want it early.

Also it's said a lot in these discussions, but AR, like cellphones, will destroy whole industries. Future mainstream glasses don't just change cellphones, but it replaces everything with a display. Your TVs, projectors, monitors (tablets, laptop screens), etc probably don't exist in the future. You can argue about timelines for this, but this is what companies are looking at. They want to have that early brand recognition and they want people to go out and pick up their glasses when the time comes. (Apple especially wants the iPhone to glasses transition to be smooth for their whole customer base).",Sirisian,22,1744649833.0

If I compress it down to something that my relatives can stream over their shitty wifi and rural Internet, then the exact same footage starts looking like it was made with a potato.

That got me thinking, and recently I tried the Blackmagic Camera app with my iPhone 16. It can record with a bit rate over 1 Gbps. The quality difference is incredible, despite being the exact same tiny phone camera as before.

Just a bunch of little bugs here and there (and some big ones, like Bluetooth pairing issues; supposedly resolved in the Android 15 update that's making its way out). 

As the other commenter mentioned, the front screen is very functional. I often don't have to open the phone when I get some notification. Which is just like every other phone, obviously, but the point is that it being a folding phone isn't a huge deficit.

You can definitely notice the crease in the screen, especially with a white background. Not sure how it compares to other foldables, but it's easy enough to ignore. 

The camera is servicable. Again, not as good as a Samsung phone, but it's rare that I've wished it were better. 

There are a few things weirdly lacking - some of the UI is chunky, the settings app is totally black and white making it hard to navigate. The UI for customizing the front screen is great though, and a lot of the moto stuff is fun. It relies on Google apps for a lot of things, which I didn't like - calendar and files are examples.

Over time new security vulnerabilities are discovered that might allow people to harvest your data or invade your network via the IOT device.

Samsung will likely maintain the software and licenses to these services over time to maintain their function or add additional services that gain popularity.

The reason I can say what I say comes down to a few things.

* There is zero controversy in stating that OLED technology is better than any LCD technology.  If you need the modest brightness advantage of QLED for a room with glare and whatnot, all that means you are trading out image quality and viewing angles for brightness (and unsolicited dithering, since there are almost no LCD TVs that don't use it).

* WOLED is right out, because luminance overshoot is a dealbreaker, and after half a decade+, they still haven't eliminated it, so it's evidently not going away.  Quite bluntly, there's an alternative panel type which just so happens to not have that issue, while also being brighter as a nice bonus.

* Sony are the only real contenders here with their A95 series which are effectively just Sony's branded iteration of Samsung's display.  But for whatever reason, Samsung consistently edges Sony out on color reproduction/accuracy, HDR gradients and (probably the most obvious) gray uniformity, which actually translates to how much array artifacting you can see in sub-5 nits scenarios‚Äîprobably the only meaningful artifact QD-OLED has.  Sony also _never supports Freesync,_ like WTF!?  You pay a premium for the Sony tax but then have to put up with missing conveniences like that because, one supposes, Sony's engineering team lives by the philosophy that a minority utility means it can be excluded outright.  But I will give the A95 series the one W in that it at least supports Dolby Vision.

As for the question of

> because the amount of weight each person assigns to those values differs,

that's why Rtings provides categories.  They know it; you know it; I know it.  They also, unambiguously, provide the category of ""best TV"", meaning in broad strokes that if your use case is broad, i.e. all else being equal, here is your TV that wins the most points in each.

Rtings is handy in concretely backing up my observations on point #3.

It's honestly almost _too_ convenient how Samsung's QD-OLEDs stand out as the obvious winner, as, speaking as somebody who has used TVs as monitors since 2010, the only other time I can point to when there was no real controversy in propping up a best display might be when LG sheepishly sorted out the latency issues they couldn't firmware patch the previous year, and became the first maker to realistically compete with PC monitors on that front, forcing the entire industry to do the same.

You are attempting to claim there can be no objectivity because some people may specifically desire this or that feature which no TV on the market covers in its entirety.  What you are instead pointing out is that an assessment can possess a trace of subjectivity.  But when one TV wins in 95% of categories, or even just in the majority of categories, you don't get to pretend that it isn't objectively the better TV.

The most subjective point of consideration when it comes to ""best TV"" is probably the A95x's Dolby Vision vs. Samsung's HDR10+, i.e. if you want dynamic metadata for Netflix or for Amazon Prime / AppleTV.  Sony could have easily won this item by including the _royalty free_ HDR10+ support alongside DV, but I already noted earlier that they seem to prefer to lock in to their own tune.

My whole objection here is that *you can't say a TV is objectively the best*, because that's not how objectivity works. Is it the best? Or is it the best for the money? Well, how much money? If you've got $200, don't buy a Samsung. If you've got $2000, maybe buy a Samsung. If you've got $20,000, don't buy a Samsung. Given that, how can you say Samsung makes the best TV? If you can spend 10x less, why can't you spend 10x more? Bringing price into the equation massively changes the scope of your claim. Isn't that an important caveat?

Really, my whole point is that what you're claiming as ""important objective qualities"" are an infinitesimal subset of things people actually care about when buying a TV. So how can you possibly claim one TV is ""best""?

You're automatically rejecting all the things that most people who buy TVs think are important differences between TVs, so I'll be really specific using the kind of thing you're talking about. The LG C4 has greater colour accuracy than the S90D. What if colour accuracy is really important to me? Can you tell me, objectively, how much it should matter that the Samsung is worse, given it is better on other metrics?

There's no ""95% of categories"", or majority of categories, because not all categories are equal, the amount each one matters differs by the individual, and there are a virtually infinite number of them.

Because 1: when you find a consumer who _does_ understand what they're buying and wants to get their hands on the best, your concern here is invalidated, and 2: if your minority was truly of little consequence then the likes of Rtings would be out of jobs‚Äîinstead, a million people have depended on them to sort out the good from the bad.

> The LG C4 has greater colour accuracy than the S90D. What if colour accuracy is really important to me?

Then, as long as you actually _do_ care about color accuracy, you'd still get the S90D, because:

* The vast majority of the minor difference in raw color accuracy can be almost completely sorted out via the TV's comprehensive non-service menu color tweaks.  A professional calibration is _not_ necessary for that.  It's actually a near certainty that most of it is solved simply by setting the TV's color scheme to ""Warm 2"" which is a Samsung user tradition.  Like Rtings noted, if you simply measure the TV out of the box, it's going to be a little too blue.  All Samsungs do this, including QLEDs.
* Again, _provided you care about color like you say,_ the difference in color gamut representation between the two models is vastly more important.  Do you want HDR or not?  I'm honestly surprised you brought up color at all.  Incidentally, if this is a sincere concern of yours, I strongly recommend an A/B at a brick and mortar so you can see for yourself.

> Like, do you think there's an objectively best car? An objectively best house? An objectively best plane?

Strawmen.  And maybe that's been your issue all along.  You have possibly internalized a false equivalency.  There can be and have been objectively best cameras, best CPUs, best GPUs etc.  Maybe I can even help you with this.  If you can't find a website whose goal is to compare competing products in a category and figure out which ones do their jobs better, whereupon they determine specimens that stand out as being head and shoulders above their competition, then consider it disqualified.  ""Cars"" for example is too broad and you'd never find an absolute winner‚Äîalthough you perhaps could have in the early 20th century.

If what you're talking about is ""best for the money"", then Hisense (or whatever, I'm not actually trying to work out optimal value per dollar TV manufacturers) makes the ""best TV"". If you're *not* talking about ""best for the money"", then the answer isn't Samsung. Maybe it's the Flander's Scientific, maybe it's some miniLED, maybe it's something in a lab somewhere. But there is no such thing as an unqualified best. It's *always* including a bunch of things that *you* assume are the only important criteria, but which other people don't necessarily agree are the important criteria. The fact that you want to dismiss other things because you think they don't count, without rational justification, is precisely what makes your commentary on ""best"" non-objective.",OneBigBug,1,1742878137.0

iPod introduced in 2001 , by the end of 2003 iTunes was already the market leader for purchasing music. 

Apples revenue from 1997 through 2003 was basically stagnating & bouncing back n forth between ~ 5.5 to $6.5 billion.  

(( also during these years earnings were dismal to very thin ‚Ä¶ 1997 = negative 0.8 billion ‚Ä¶ then 0.5B, 0.6B 0.4 , 0.3 , 0.035 , 0.2B for years 1998-2003 respectively. )) 

In 2004 revenue = $9.7 billion ‚Ä¶ 2005, 16.2 Billion ‚Ä¶ 2006= 20.7B    2007= 26.5B  2008= 34.8B ‚Ä¶ 

In first quarter of 2007 iPods were still responsible for 50% of Apples revenue. 

( iPhone is introduced in 2008 , so revenues continue to grow but iPod sales start declining and  making up less and less % of Apples total revenue ) 

It really becomes obvious when you look at earnings vs  revenue ‚Ä¶ 

‚Ä¶ also when you consider the first apple retail store in introduced 2001 , is almost instantly successful and by 2011 , it‚Äôs the #1 retail location in terms sales vs square footage etc etc. 

I just don‚Äôt feel like iMacs were moving the needle much at all before IPods  really started bringing widespread attention to Apple again.

This isn't really new. The reason this hasn't been commercialized has always been cost and scale. The article doesn't really talk about the technology but presumably they made some improvements to the manufacturing process. It is just another incremental step. Nobody has found an easy way to place millions of LEDs in a way that is cost effective enough consumers could afford it, yet.

Sony has shown earlier versions of this. I believe it was called Crystal LED and was shown at CES. Samsung similarly has been showing ""The Wall"" microLED TV for years. 

Believe it or not this tech has been around even longer than that. The massive displays you see in stadiums? Direct RGB LEDs just like this. It has just been prohibitively expensive to scale for general consumers. The way in which the image is generated is actually much simpler than LCD.

This is also the same thing as microLED technology by some definitions. I like that they aren't using the term microLED because there are actually 2 very different types of display that have both been called ""microLED"" and it gets confusing. They are differentiated by their manufacturing process. This display and Samsung's ""The Wall"" (marketed as ""microLED"") transfer millions of microLEDs from a wafer and spread them out over the display. Apple was also working on microLED displays for their devices (sadly no longer) and their tech would also fall under this first category. The second type of microLED display (which I personally think should retain the ""microLED"" name) leaves the microLEDs tightly packed on the wafer and directly bonds them to a backplane. This second type of microLED is for very tiny displays (even smaller than a watch) that will likely be used in future AR glasses. 

There is no official definition of how small the LED has to be before it is called a ""microLED"". Even relatively small microLEDs only a few microns wide are plenty bright for a TV. The main thing that dictates the microLED size in these large format displays is cost, not performance. Bigger LEDs use more material and thus cost more. There are some papers out there that estimate based on cost even large TVs like this will probably need to use microLEDs about 10 microns wide (or less) to be meet the bottom line.

Performance wise it will beat (or tie) LCD and OLED in just about every way. Brightness, contrast, efficiency, lifetime, viewing angle, refresh rate etc will all be better. Color purity is debatable and really depends on the LEDs used. But it will cost you.",ICantBeliveUDoneThis,3,1742003835.0

Also, companies pretty much never brick all devices at once, as it's going to be too suspicious and could bring court cases. They usually do it slowly...

Real life example: I remember a few years ago I had an older iPhone (3y) and a new update made my phone not working properly, it turned out I wasn't alone with that update and identical issues, but my friend from USA never actually received the 'bricking' update even though had same phone model.

iPhone,gadgets,1iuihb1,"Apple, Lenovo lead losers in laptop repairability analysis",me60q0d,"From the component-level repair perspective, Lenovo is a piece of garbage.

1. Some devices use internally programmed USB-C controllers. If you don‚Äôt have the firmware, you can‚Äôt flash a clean one to fix a very basic charging circuit repair, which is easy on most PC laptops and all Macs.

2. Modern devices tend to use Lenovo ThinkEngine as an SIO chip, which means if it dies, you need to find a donor to fix it.

3. **WORST shit.** They have been using low-temp solder for a few years now, with a melting point of around 138¬∞C. It is fragile as shit‚Äîit dies if the mainboard bends (it fucking bends as you type on the keyboard or grab the laptop by a corner). This leads to all sorts of ripped BGA issues‚Äîmemory, CPU, SIO, and inrush MOSFETs literally soldering themselves off the board (which has become a signature problem on certain Lenovo devices).

4. **Even worse shit.** **Compound.**

Because of point 3, Lenovo decided to glue chips onto the board with an extremely hard adhesive. It‚Äôs way tougher than on iPhones, Macs, or even automotive devices. On newer devices, it hardens further when heated. This makes trivial repairs **extremely** difficult. Some adhesive variants are thermally unstable, which means: you solder a GDDR chip near the GPU, keep everything around it as cool as possible, but remember the 138¬∞C solder? You finish the job, and now the chips around it need reballing too because the solder popped out from the compound.

Removing chips on some devices is extremely challenging. I have a **Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 9** here, which just needs a simple SIO reballing (it only turns on if you press on the chip, which is a 100% easy fix on any device except Lenovo). Most likely, I will have to **drill it away**, since pulling it under heat would likely damage the PCB and rip off lots of pads. So instead of a 30-minute job (including disassembly), it becomes a **‚Äúhard case‚Äù** simply because of its manufacturing design.

I happen to know someone who has access to Lenovo‚Äôs internal remanufacturing kitchen‚ÄîLenovo themselves **have no adhesive removal method**. If they need to remove a CPU from a board, they **CNC-drill it away**.

What the Maga boneheads don't or won't believe is that very little of the actual manufacturing infrastructure exists in the US to build something even close to an iPhone or any other flagship. The fab technology Apple uses in their 3nm processors is exclusive to TSMC in Taiwan and is a trade secret. Even Apple doesn't know how to do it, not that they actually manufacture anything. They design circuitry and components that are made by subcontracted manufacturing partners and assembled by other manufacturing partners. The same is true of Samsung and their 4nm and 5nm processes. There's no chip fab in the US that can duplicate this.

According to one analysis I saw, if something like an iPhone ProMax was actually manufactured here, in the US, the end cost to the ""consumer"" would be on the order of $50k.

Samsung,gadgets,1isqufv,Humane is shutting down the AI Pin and selling its remnants to HP,mdr6oeo,"They do actually make that product, except it's a watch, not a badge (Fitbit, 
Pixel watch, or Samsung watch)

The watch form factor has many advantages over a badge.  
You can wear a watch even when naked, and don't need to worry about transferring it to new outfits. There is enough space for a screen to show text/images and scroll through lists. It's firmly attached to your wrist, you can get away with a bit more weight than something flapping around on your shirt. Since it has direct contact to skin, it can monitor biometrics such as heart rate. Watches are already normalised in society, so people don't really notice smartwatches.

I guess there is nothing stopping you mounting a smart watch as a badge. 

IMO, the only advantage the badge form factor has over a watch form factor is that you can put a camera on it, and that camera will see roughly what you can see.   

Though the general public seems to get really weirded out by people wearing cameras, it's continually killed any attempt at the smart glasses form factor.  I suspect humane went with the badge form factor as an attempted end-run around this general distrust, as people are much less likely to notice something chest mounted.

For your smart home usecase, there is also the option of buying several smart speakers and distributing them around the house. They are reasonably cheap, and have decent range for picking up your voice, and are designed for this usecase.",phire,1,1740028736.0

Who writes these sort of headlines? Its not win10 where 50% of people are choosing not to upgrade ebecause they can't or won't. For android, either the device can and has been upgraded, or its too old to be upgraded, at which its probably thrown away; few people stick to old android partly because theres not many good reasons to stick with an older version unless you want to go pre material you. And with the recent push to force devs to update play store apps at least once a year, backwards compatibility is dependent on active devs and forward compatibility is at risk as the min SDK target keeps creeping up.

Yes, people below will say they won't upgrade their phones, thats great. I doubt the average android user does the same, and I think the distribution of OS versions recorded by google shows this.

Two months later OneUI 7 is still not available on 2 year-old phones (that they have been supporting for all 24 months leading up to this).

Whether or not you care is up to you, but needy enthusiasts are the reason why we have long-term OS updates today. It's not because users are promoting patience and trust for the brand.

Now Good Lock modules you could make an argument for being adjacent to OneUI since they only work on Samsung phones, and One Handed Operation Plus is the single greatest piece of UI software in existence in my opinion, and I combine it with Nova Launcher.

OneUI Launcher is still very underwhelming compared to Nova, but it could include these features with some effort.  Replace folder icons with any icon.  Swipe up / swipe down commands on icons.  Larger grid.  Easy individual icon settings.  All of these have been around for a decade now on Nova.

Would love to see OneUI Home be able to do all of this natively:

Samsung,android,1jx4jji,Give me one reason now bar is an improvement over previous live notifications. I'll give you,mmpjhi5,"> Can no longer see multiple live notifications at once.

You couldn't do this before the Now Bar existed, so I'm not quite sure why this is an issue.

The media controls are still found in the quick settings area and allow you to swipe between different media sources like before.

> Can no longer swipe between media sources (even outside of lock screen) once you open a new one, the previous is gone. You'll need to go back to your home screen and reopen the app. One UI 6 you could have a whole bunch of them in there. How is this better?

Incorrect. 

On the lock screen, tap on the Now Bar to expand it into the full view and swipe to switch between the media sources you want to control.

When unlocked, simply swipe between media sources from the player panel in the quick settings like it always has been. This behaviour hasn't changed.

> No viewing of time of track, podcast, video, whatever unless you click the now bar where no other notifications will be visable. So if you want to click your power button and see where the time's at while you're walking you can't just hit the power button and take a look at the time situation. You have to click the NOW BAR. OOOOO THE NOW BAR! Gimme a break 

The Now Bar remains in expanded view if you tap on it and turn the screen off and back on afterwards, so at worst you are tapping it once. If the intent is to limit interaction while taking the device out of your pocket, well, things like raise to wake and always on display exist for this reason.

> If you look at points 1 and 2, on one UI 6 you could literally be on your navigation app, and keep track of where you're going, while controlling multiple media players. So let's say you're watching a podcast then a friend sends you a link to a YouTube video or Spotify track and you take a listen and go straight back to your podcast. Now it's a whole lot more F***ing about for what? What advantage have now made it worth the change?

What a weird use case to point out that it's worse. Who is navigating while controlling multiple media players?

It sounds more like your issues with using the Now Bar are down to familiarity with how media playback controls previously worked.

Samsung runs their mobile products like L'Oreal runs their haircare.

L'Oreal owns an extensive amount of brands, explicitly targeting the drugstore, entry level salon, more pricey salon, and then luxury.

Redken is a great example of how Samsung operates. Compared to a lot of salon brands, they been cheaper to get started with and have an extremely extensive styling range in terms of amount of products, hold level variety, and different textures. Now, it is a bit smaller, but it is still on the larger side and it is red routinely seen at fashion week for a reason.

How is this relevant? Redken is known for reformulating or moving ingredients anytime it is necessary to avoid having a price increase, because again, L'Oreal has pigeonholed them as a more affordable salon brand for the consumer. So they can never go up in price, they can only attempt to tweak or remove ingredients to get the desired MSRP.

It‚Äôs expected to be priced around $1,500 in 2028. However, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to drop to around $1,600.

>The Pixel Fold will also decrease in price again in 2027, bringing it to around $1,500.

So far this reads like ""speculation"" based on ""trust me bro I have a source."" Uncertainty about the veracity of the source aside, pricing strategy changes on a monthly or even weekly basis. There is no way to know for certain how they'll price these phones until the moment they actually release it. Companies are known to change pricing of products down to the last minute.

>We‚Äôre told by a source familiar with the situation that Google is going to be increasing the price of the Pixel 10 Pro XL (notably not the Pixel 10 Pro). We‚Äôre expecting it go up by around $100, which would bring the Pixel 10 Pro XL to $1200 and add a larger gap between the three phones (four phones if you count the Pixel Fold). 

As noted in the article, I wonder if they're also doing the iPhone 15/16 Pro Max thing, where they eliminate the base 128GB version and the $1200 one starts at 256GB of storage. Otherwise I see few reasons to go with an XL over the base.

>Update: This article previously noted that the Pixel 9 was $699 and going up to $799 for Pixel 10. That‚Äôs incorrect, Pixel 10 will remain at $799.

This puts further doubt on the validity of their claims in my lens. While they were quick to edit their mistake, it shows that they didn't double check their numbers before publishing. The Pixel 9 has been out for more than half a year and its higher $799 price tag over the Pixel 8 at $699 has been extensively discussed. At minimum the author is unfamiliar with the Pixel lineup.

They could also keep it short and just say our target was a 40% profit margin on each unit.

With my 2 year replacement cycle it is kind of a non starter. I agree it should cost more than a premium case but $70-80 tops.

I give it a C+ for addressing the pricing complaints. They listed some sources that drive up the cost (mostly just saying quality) but I would want to hear more numbers.

Today the ""cutting edge"" bar is set by the Chinese android phones. Not Apple nor Samsung or Google.

They are making foldable phones that when folded are as thing as the iPhone Pro Max, while also having larger batteries...

I wouldn't get my hopes up with this phone in terms of being on the edge of tech. Apple hasn't adopted Silicon carbon batteries yet. Has relatively slow charging speeds. No true optical zoom. No super large image sensors. Limited amount of RAM. Still has 120hz screens limited to their Pro phones.

I mean, it's gonna be almost a decade by the time they jump into the foldable market since they first appeared...

It surely will be a good product and premium and all of that, but this Apple hasn't pushed the envelope with tech on phones. With the exception, of course, of their chips.

It's the first time Apple has taken the top spot during the first quarter, capturing 19% of the global market.

>The iPhone maker's success came despite economic uncertainties, with Apple benefiting from the iPhone 16e launch and strong performance in emerging markets. Starting at $599, the iPhone 16e was released by Apple in March to replace the iPhone SE, the most affordable device in the company's lineup.

>Samsung followed in second place with 18% market share, continuing its gradual decline from 21% in Q1 2023. The Korean manufacturer experienced a slow start due to the late launch of its S25 series, but saw sales improve in March.

>Xiaomi kept tight to its growth trajectory to secure third position with 14% of the market, up from 13% a year earlier. The Chinese company's expansion benefited from growth in its domestic market, where its entry into electric vehicles has enhanced its brand presence. Meanwhile, vivo and OPPO rounded out the top five.

>The global smartphone market grew 3% year-over-year in Q1 2025, but Counterpoint has revised its annual forecast and now expects a slight decline for the full year. The adjustment is due to rising economic uncertainties, particularly related to tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.

>Counterpoint believes that economic volatility could lead consumers to postpone smartphone purchases, which could potentially disrupt the supply chain and increase trade risks.

>Apple's performance was notably regional in nature. While sales remained flat or declined in the U.S., Europe, and China, the company achieved double-digit growth in Japan, India, Middle East and Africa, and Southeast Asia.",ControlCAD,23,1744647895.0

The whole point is you don't need to get an iPad and carry two things with you (requiring you to have  a separate bag to carry it in most cases) if you have a foldable phone.

The crease becomes near invisible when you are looking at the screen straight down - which is what you would actually do when you actually use it. I get some people may be bothered by the existence of crease but I'd say give it a real try because very few actual users of foldables complain about crease, or even when they do, other advantages make up well for it.

Expensive (but decent) keyboard ""folios"", stands, mouse support, USB-C dongles to connect external displays, and now they want to bend iPadOS to become ""more like macOS"".

They're trying to turn iPads into MacBooks. But MacBooks already exists, and are already so much more cost-effective and practical than an iPad with tons of accessoirs. Plus MacBooks run all the *actual* software, not some cut-down restricted barely functional iPadOS app counterpart with tedious inter-app file exchange issues.

IMO, iPads have no business trying to be MacBooks, because MacBooks already do such a good job at being MacBooks. Same goes in the other direction, iPads have no business trying to be iPhones, since iPhones themselves are already so powerful and do such a good job at being iPhones.

These days, apart from use as a pop-up display, or a graphics tablet, or a note-taking slate, or an ebook reader - I fail to see anything that an iPad could do better or easier than an iPhone and/or a MacBook.

iPhone,apple,1jy6fvb,Gurman: iPadOS 19 to be 'more like macOS' in major overhaul,mn08fmw,"The OS quite literally *is* mac osx / darwin under the hood.

You're just not allowed any user-level access to it. And all of the macos frameworks, darwin macos windowserver, etc., are not present.

Throw in a terminal emulator, user access with full / unlocked priveleges, and the full bsd userland (which is *probably* missing / not present) with network, fs, etc., drivers, and you'd have a full blown macos (or more accurately: unix non-graphical unix with bash / whatever) on basically everything from an iphone to ipad to tv box to *maybe* (or then again probably not) apple watch.

They're all quite literally running darwin / forked darwin, just with different userlands + UI shells (or rather lack thereof), and different dev frameworks that you're supposed to use and hook into.

The latter is the core problem and why you'll basically never get a real / actual pc operating system on the ipad, vision headset, or what have you. Those are all afaik very directly forked off of ios with extremely limited and non-pc-ish capabilities, restrictions, and core API / app concepts.

ipados is terrible, and will continue to remain terrible, because the approach is and will remain / continue to be to just try to reimplement a really, really crappy pseudo-window-server\[1\] + app user interface framework, from scratch, on top of ios / ipados garbage, instead of just porting over the macos window server, macos frameworks, and the full bsd userland etc etc

\[1\] which mind you wouldn't run well at all on *most* ipads (excl the m-series) b/c they don't have anywhere near enough ram.

Plus the ports are terrible / lightning is f---ing godawful, and apple damn well probably / almost certainly isn't ever going to bother to try implementing thunderbolt / 3rd party usable and fully PC (ie mac) compatible PCIe + displayport on their mobile hardware (nevermind the ipads that are literally using mac SOCs lol), so your ability to actually connect those to and do much of anything with most / nearly all ipads anyways is going to be crippled anyways.

It's overall a really dumb / myopic bit of long term strategy + decision making / lack thereof on apple's part, IMO, b/c they in fact *are* and have been extremely well positioned to eg. just build a dockable phone / tablet that *could* run full-blown macos when plugged into literally kbm/monitor thunderbolt setup. Which would yes somewhat cannibalize mac sales but would also give an actual *reason* for people to actually care about and make real use of apple's incremental YoY phone/tablet hardware improvements, and push *relevant* user-facing planned obsolescence forwards by another decade or two, or three. And which would to be clear be massively transformational and useful from basically any and all end user's perspectives. ie why bother having a business laptop to do excel and powerpoints or whatever when your laptop *is* just the phone in your pocket, something to plug it into, and a small breakout thunderbolt 5 hub or whatever. But I digress.

As is I swear to god, xiaomi or huawei is probably going to *somehow* end up doing this at some point or another, *despite not actually having a decent full featured PC OS to work with*, before apple. (samsung has ofc *tried* to do this, repeatedly, but GLHF there)

Minor rant: the folks running apple's software divisions (and long term planning / thereof) are *not* particularly brilliant nor innovative, and haven't been so for well over a decade at least.

Also, to be clear. Apple to be clear *isn't* doing this because doing this / turning ios + everything else into a dockable thing that can run a full blown PC OS with *ideally* open and extensible PCIe etc over thunderbolt would be a MASSIVE and extremely ambitious / painful PITA thing to try to actually do, from an engineering, software (and even hardware) perspective.

They typically move slow and focus on generating stable income, not necessarily innovating. Not to say Apple will never innovate again. But expecting another iPhone level smash is unlikely. They have made some missteps for sure, but it isn't like Microsoft, Google, Meta, or anyone is doing anything super exciting anyway besides AI like what everyone is doing anyway. Most of the new tech has been for business related matters anyway with some smaller stuff here and there. Eventually tech cannot forever just innovate and create super exciting ideas year by year. The company just needs some time for research and development, and it may come one day. For now, you have super phones, tablets, tvs, headphones, laptops, and more.

I remember learning in business school that the only reason Apple wasn't becoming like the cash cows of Microsoft, IBM etc was because Apple kept re-upping their cycles with new market changing products, iPod, iPod shuffle, iPhones, iPads, Macbook Air etc etc. 

Scott Forstall (a name only some of the older heads here might remember) was set to take over Apple, he was very similar to jobs with creative work and innovation. When Jobs passed the board overlooked Forstall and picked Tim Cook. Cook fired Forstall for a pedantic reason, not apologizing for how poorly apple maps flopped. Cook isn't an innovator, but he was a genius at supply chain. He was great at maximizing the value of supplies and parts which is what the board wanted to squeeze every dollar out of the stock price for Apple. This is why after Jobs passed, every iPhone a year after was the same chassis design and reused old parts from previous years. Jobs didn't care about waste or completely redesigning the device each year while Cook prefers to reuse everything from years ago to maximize value out of old inventory.

The reason the iPhone worked isn‚Äôt simply because those guys were visionaries, it‚Äôs because the tech had evolved to a point where that product was possible in the first place.

The iPhone was possible because we had fast enough processors that were energy efficient enough to run on mobile, batteries that could be small yet powerful enough, cheap enough solid state storage, cellular networks that could support data, development of multitouch, and so on. It was a unique confluence of technology almost all at once.

Since then, most tech components have evolved off of those things, rather than being big enough to contribute to some other revolutionary platform. What else is there? A TV set is too banal; a home hub is too passive; a car is too complex; headsets are too annoying; AI is a solution in search of a problem.

If you look at the state of the market at the time, *nobody else* was thinking of building a touch screen phone in the way Apple was. Everyone was convinced smartphones were this low powered, low res screens, PDAs with mobile connectivity which required a keyboard and stylus to use properly.

Even the iPhone-ish devices like LG Prada had a built in keyboard and its operating system was a terrible, stuttering, Flash based OS that looked more like a dumbphone OS than a true next gen OS. What the iPhone brought to the table was a fully fleshed OS based on a *desktop operating system* with desktop-class web browsing and apps. The development environment (once the SDK came out in 2008) blew away everyone else on the market at the time with their crappy Java applets, and allowed Mac developers to use their Objective-C and Cocoa skills to make great iPhone apps. Nobody else had things like Core Animation, Core Data, a powerful UI toolkit like Cocoa Touch, etc. iOS itself was based on Mac OS, that was huge! Nobody else did it that way before.

Even if the technologies were there, Apple was the only one who managed to put them together in a way that made sense, revolutionised the market and made everyone else follow in iPhone's footsteps, and left competitors in the dust for \~5-10 years until they managed to create truly competitive products and not just cheap iPhone knockoffs.

When the iPhone came out the reactions were:

* ""We sell billions of phones, we'll be fine"" - Nokia
* ""The computer guys aren't going to figure out how to make a smartphone, what they've show on stage must be a trick"" - BlackBerry
* ""$500? That's the most expensive phone and doesn't even have a keyboard, plus no business support"" - Microsoft
* ""Crap, we gotta start over with our UI"" - Google because they were building a BlackBerry clone at the time
* ""Crap we need a new OS ASAP"" - Palm

Clearly Cook is not a ‚Äúbad CEO‚Äù, they have thrived and made a fortune under his tenure. However, just comparing his leadership (and who he promotes/hires/culture/etc), and look back at the pre-iPhone R&D:  
Other companies were working on full touchscreen phones already. But they were working with established touchscreen technologies, and screen technology, which was affordable but had limitations, kind of like the chin bezel we saw for a long time.  
Steve not only focused on hiring creatives, but when they showed him options he knew the value in usability. And I think that‚Äôs how Apple went with Capacitive screens, refined their multitouch to be accurate, with natural motion and elasticity. And they went thru countless hardware designs until they found a way to engineer an equal size bezel for the screen.  
  
I‚Äôm not saying for certain that Tim Cook would make different decisions in that scenario, but it certainly seems to me he has a lower bar for ‚Äúacceptable usability‚Äù to release something, and so I think details like that could easily get missed if it were very expensive.  
And as a whole, I do not feel like Tim or even some of the other Apple Execs, really use the whole suite of their products in day-to-day; like I can‚Äôt imagine their top 5 execs have regularly been using Siri,  Reminders app, Calendar, iOS Mail, THEMSELVES on the daily. There‚Äôs just too many longstanding issues that a creative would say ‚Äúhey can this work better? Less clicks, more view options, better snooze, richer notifications, etc?‚Äù.  
I don‚Äôt doubt their assistant fills out a calendar for them, and they probably use Mac Mail app, but not the mobile stuff and not the DETAILS.  
  
I hope that makes sense; it‚Äôs not that their top people are doing a terrible job, it‚Äôs that there is often not a clear vision of refinement AND  innovation, at the same time.  
  
There are plenty of exceptions BOTH ways here: Steve released some products he knew were half baked, and just plain bad. And under Tim we have seen great things like AirPods, Vision Pro OS, etc.",frockinbrock,2,1744490924.0

What? What was I using on my smartphones all these years before the M1? And my videogame console? Geesh, what do you have to read these days...

When the M1 launched Apple probably didn't even know what a LLM was, hence the issues they have now. But they've been doing unified memory since the first iPhone, or what do you think the RAM on a phone means? Do you think you get separate video and audio memory from the main? Every smartphone in existence way before the M1 chip has unified memory. AMD does this too with their APUs, again, this before the M1.

Great, so Canadian customers don't have to pay tariffs. (Which is already the case.)

What if ***US citizens*** want to buy an iPhone? Oh shit, then they pay tariffs because it is still being imported *from Canada.*

Further, because the iPhone is manufactured in China, it actually gets hit with tariffs twice, making it even more expensive for Americans. CUSMA exemptions only apply to goods that are Canadian in origin. It'll get tariffed for the Chinese components, and then tariffed *again* as a Canadian import.

But Maps was buggy one year, and the Clock team failed to license the [Swiss railways clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_railway_clock) design, costing Apple a few million, and so that became the excuse and impetuous. 

Before Cook took over, Jobs created a culture where the team leaders competed their ideas, and Jobs would hear all arguments and then decide ""Ok we're going in Forstall's direction."" Thats how we got *iOS and iPhone* instead of an *iPod with a phonefunction* like Tony Fadell wanted. 

When you remove Jobs' ability to manage high-strung personalities, and decide between them, and you're Cook, then the arguing and competitiveness feels like ""conflict and fighting for power."" So Cook got rid of those people. And he also wanted to protect Jony Ive.

Theres a great book titled 'Corporate Lifecycles: How and Why Corporations Grow and Die and What to Do About It'

The gist is that companies are started by ""founders"" or ""visionaries"" who want to spend 10x money to create 100x value by creating a product that means something and soars the company. And when that product stagnates, and so the company stagnates, and the financials stagnate‚Äîthey have the creativity to do it again‚Äîto create a new product that means something and soars the company‚Äîagain! And again! And again!

Sound familiar?

Steve Jobs. The Apple II. Then NeXTSTEP which became OS X. Then the iMac G3. Then the Mac laptops. Then the iPod. Then the iPhone. Then the iPad.

But eventually founders get bought out, or run out, or die‚Äîand the money people come in and manage those products as long as they can, but if they let it become a money culture where they wear suits and manage by spread sheet‚Äîit's only a matter of time. Happens to almost every company, eventually.

Cook managed to bypass this issue by realizing his weakness‚Äîhe's not a visionary‚Äîso he leaned on his team to be the visionaries and be the managers of products‚Äîwhile he focuses on his strengths as CEO which is operations. 

But I think this story shows Cook fucked up and fell back on his instincts to care about operations and money over product‚Äîhe didn't listen to his product guy. And its a taste of what happens when the top guy isn't a product guy. When the rubber meets the road they look down on product guys, don't take them as serious, views them as ""cost.""",78914hj1k487,4,1744428791.0

iPhone,apple,1jwgmz6,Apple Hit With More Class Action Lawsuits Over Delayed Siri Features in U.S. and Canada,mmi9fdq,"From the article:
>In the U.S., a complaint filed in a California federal court this week alleges that Apple violated false advertising and unfair competition laws by marketing Apple Intelligence upgrades for Siri that are still not available. The two named plaintiffs said they never would have purchased or been willing to pay as much for an iPhone 16 had they known that Apple's marketing surrounding the features was false and misleading.

>Apple advertised the Siri features in product presentations, on its website, in a TV commercial starring actor Bella Ramsey, and elsewhere.

>Apple was already sued over the delayed Siri features in California last month, and the class action lawsuits could eventually be merged if they proceed.

>A similar complaint was filed against Apple last week in the Canadian province of British Columbia.

>Apple first previewed the personalized Siri features during its WWDC 2024 keynote last June, as part of a wide range of Apple Intelligence features that it said would be rolling out over the course of the following year. That gave Apple until WWDC 2025 this June to roll out the Siri features, but last month the company announced that it needed more time and anticipated rolling out the features at some point ""in the coming year"" from then.

>The features were initially expected to launch in iOS 18.4 last week, but they are now expected to arrive at some point during the iOS 19 cycle. Many well-connected Apple reporters and observers believe the features will not be available until 2026.

>Whenever they launch, the Siri upgrades will include understanding of a user's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.

>The class action lawsuits in the U.S. and Canada are both seeking damages from Apple, in an amount to be proven at trial, so class members who purchased an iPhone 16 in order to use the personalized Siri features could eventually receive a payout from Apple, if the judges presiding over each case find that the company broke the law.

Steve ignored him for some time, but the MS guy persisted. It was later that Jobs really got pissed off and decided to show MS and the world how a tablet is supposed to be done!

But i have also read NYTimes piece on how the iPhone came to be, and in that I read that after buying a small startup that specialised in multitouch interface (an innovation at that time), while testing it out, the people at Apple made a larger screen first, which was essentially a tablet, or the very first iPad. But since tablet as a concept wasn't known to the masses during that time, Jobs decided to debut the multitouch concept in the iPod Touch. After its wild success, they decided that instead of having users carry 2 separate devices with them - the iPod Touch and the mobile phone, what if they just combined the 2?

Apple apparently weighed up multiple options for the backend of ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå. One initial idea was to build both small and large language models, dubbed ""Mini Mouse"" and ""Mighty Mouse,"" to run locally on iPhones and in the cloud, respectively. ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå's leadership then decided to go in a different direction and build a single large language model to handle all requests via the cloud, before a series of further technical pivots. The indecision and repeated changes in direction reportedly frustrated engineers and prompted some members of staff to leave Apple.

In addition to Apple's deeply ingrained stance on privacy, conflicting personalities within Apple contributed to the problems. More than half a dozen former employees who worked in Apple's AI and machine-learning group told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution, citing an overly relaxed culture, as well as a lack of ambition and appetite for taking risks when designing future versions of ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå.

Apple's AI/ML group has been dubbed ""AIMLess"" internally, while employees are said to refer to ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå as a ""hot potato"" that is continually passed between different teams with no significant improvements. There were also conflicts about higher pay, faster promotions, longer vacations, and shorter days for colleagues in the AI group.",chrisdh79,1425,1744296293.0

iPhone,apple,1jvzmhq,Report Reveals Internal Chaos Behind Apple's Siri Failure,mmg7z7i,"It's not make or break. But this overall lack of being able to deliver polished and finished products is the type of thing that put Apple into financial troubles in the 90s.

Yes, Apple is a world-leading tech company. But they're losing their touch for what they became known for: refined and incredibly engineered hardware and software.

Smartphones existed before iPhone, but the iPhone was so well designed it set the standard for the smartphone platform. Same with the iPod--no one made an mp3 player that had an incredibly user friendly design before Apple.

Take the Vision Pro for example--it's a mess. It's slop, even. The hardware is great, I'm sure. But it's not special. It's a Mac strapped to your head with no killer feature. We all know AR/VR, but unlike the iPhone and iPod, it fails to redefine the category of AR/VR headsets. It has no apps, not even media ones like YouTube or Netflix. The fact you have to use Safari to do that is insane-it should have not shipped without those apps being available.

You could argue, well, the iPhone didn't even ship with an app store. And that's true, but it redefined how you use the web on a phone. It shipped with a full desktop class browser. The iPod had a revolutionary UI for organizing music on a handheld device. AFAIK, there weren't many mp3 players before the iPod that organized the UI the way Apple did.

I was really excited to see if Apple Intelligence Siri could really do all it claimed--they were going to implement it's features in a really imaginative and useful way. But it was nothing more than a concept. Apple should not have advertised a concept video and said they were shipping it. Apple Intelligence was investor-porn, not a real product they could ship.

(I'm one of those that stretches the argument that the iPhone specifically spawned entire industries, such as Uber and Instagram, which then later influences things like AirBnB and Snapchat \[and within that argument I'd even be snarky and say that the iPhone spawned Android as we know it\] but that is a huge opinionated tangent).   
  
Tim, Apple (inc), the iPhone, etc all occupied a specific piece in the timeline; specifically the iPhone existed before/during the time we were all hyperconnected. I do not think that the Vision Pro can do that, and I am doubtful that Tim can do it either. Maybe Jony Ive comes back, and maybe, just maybe, the Vision Pro is a massive hit, but I don't think those things will happen.

In summary, I think Tim is great, and I think Vision Pro is cool, but neither of those is a 2010 Tim or 2010 iPhone or a 2010 market and it's going to take not just a new product, but a new product guy to keep pushing this company forward.",Syonoq,1,1744378593.0

Tons of people do. Tons of people also didn't wear watches before the Apple Watch, so I don't put much stock into what people do right now. 

>I'm not going to start wearing glasses just for that.

Apple will still sell products other than glasses, so use those instead. Also, Apple doesn't make products just for you‚Ä¶ask any iPhone mini fan. 

>Most people will continue to own a TV/projector, have a large screen on their desk, and use a phone.

They will, until they don't‚Ä¶just like with smartphones. 

>And yet it really isn't.

That doesn't matter. It was a common opinion as I said. In fact, people were so convinced that they ignored a decade-plus of ""desktop OSes don't work well with touchscreens"" arguments against macOS on the iPad and went straight to Mac apps on the *finger-driven* headset. 

>Even if it ran MacOS, it would still be powered by their slowest chip. That's not going to replace all of their Macs for professional use.

No, a headset does not need to run (only) a regular M-series chip. You can just put a fast processor in a separate box that connects to the headset. Every Apple product that uses something higher than a regular chip is either a desktop or a relatively large laptop, so you're not giving up portability. 

Also, saying that the headset can be a Mac replacement does not imply that the headset can replace every single Mac for every single task (otherwise almost nothing could be a replacement of anything). For example, desktop replacement laptops lack the performance of the highest-end desktops, but are still called replacements. 

>Not by anyone intelligent. Do I need to explain how the two aren't similar at all?

Let me explain to you why they are similar. 

Both smartphones and glasses have the potential to replace several existing products with a single device that is as portable as each individual product. 

That's why people thought glasses would be the next smartphone. 

You may respond with a long explanation of differences, but the similarities are what matter in this discussion.",iMacmatician,1,1744356154.0

iPhone,apple,1jvucj4,Bank of America: US-Made iPhones Would Face 90% Cost Surge,mmd3jka,"From the article: Moving iPhone production from China to the United States could increase manufacturing costs by up to 90%, analysts at Bank of America warned on Wednesday (via [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-09/apple-s-iphone-cost-could-rise-90-if-it-s-made-in-us-bofa-says)).

Apple iPhone 16 family lineup
According to BofA analysts led by Wamsi Mohan, shifting iPhone assembly to America is technically possible, however it would dramatically increase production expenses and create logistical complications.

""iPhone cost can increase 25% purely on higher labor cost in the U.S.,"" the analysts wrote in a note to clients. They explained that even if Apple finds domestic workers for final assembly, a ""significant portion"" of iPhone components would still need to be manufactured in China and imported to the States.

Assuming Apple faces reciprocal tariffs on those imported components, the total manufacturing cost could rise by 90% or more, the analysts estimated.

The analysis follows statements from President Trump earlier this week calling Apple's manufacturing in China ""unsustainable."" According to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Trump ""absolutely"" believes Apple could manufacture iPhones in the United States. During a recent media briefing, Leavitt said the President believes ""we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it.""

Trump's aggressive trade policies singled out China on Wednesday, pausing reciprocal tariffs on 185 countries for 90 days but increasing duties on Chinese imports to 125%. In response, China has imposed 84% retaliatory levies on American goods. It's becoming increasingly difficult to assess where the stand-off goes from here.

Uncertainty caused by the trade war has battered Apple's stock, which has fallen 14% since Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, erasing approximately $479 billion in market capitalization. Despite a recent 10% rebound, Apple shares remain down 23% year-to-date.",chrisdh79,36,1744279820.0

iPhone,apple,1jvzjzu,How Apple Fumbled Siri‚Äôs AI Makeover,mmeauty,"Summary from [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/chaos-behind-siri-revealed/)


A new report from The Information today reveals much of the internal turmoil behind Apple Intelligence's revamped version of Siri.

Apple apparently weighed up multiple options for the backend of ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå. One initial idea was to build both small and large language models, dubbed ""Mini Mouse"" and ""Mighty Mouse,"" to run locally on iPhones and in the cloud, respectively. ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå's leadership then decided to go in a different direction and build a single large language model to handle all requests via the cloud, before a series of further technical pivots. The indecision and repeated changes in direction reportedly frustrated engineers and prompted some members of staff to leave Apple.

In addition to Apple's deeply ingrained stance on privacy, conflicting personalities within Apple contributed to the problems. More than half a dozen former employees who worked in Apple's AI and machine-learning group told The Information that poor leadership is to blame for its problems with execution, citing an overly relaxed culture, as well as a lack of ambition and appetite for taking risks when designing future versions of ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå.

Apple's AI/ML group has been dubbed ""AIMLess"" internally, while employees are said to refer to ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå as a ""hot potato"" that is continually passed between different teams with no significant improvements. There were also conflicts about higher pay, faster promotions, longer vacations, and shorter days for colleagues in the AI group.

Apple AI chief John Giannandrea was apparently confident he could fix ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå with the right training data and better web-scraping for answers to general knowledge questions. Senior leaders didn't respond with a sense of urgency to the debut of ChatGPT in 2022; Giannandrea told employees that he didn't believe chatbots like ChatGPT added much value for users.

In 2023, Apple managers told engineers that they were forbidden from including models from other companies in final Apple products and could only use them to benchmark against their own models, but Apple's own models ""didn't perform nearly as well as OpenAI's technology.""

Meanwhile, ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå leader Robby Walker focused on ""small wins"" such as reducing wait times for ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå responses. One of Walker's pet projects was removing the ""hey"" from the ""hey ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå"" voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took over two years to achieve. He also shot down an effort from a team of engineers to use LLMs to give ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress.

Apple started a project codenamed ""Link"" to develop voice commands to control apps and complete tasks for the Vision Pro, with plans to allow users to navigate the web and resize windows with voice alone, as well as support commands from multiple people in a shared virtual space to collaborate. Most of these features were dropped because of the ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå team's inability to achieve them.

The report claims that the demo of ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå's most impressive features at WWDC 2024, such as where ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå accesses a user's emails to find real-time flight data and provides a reminder about lunch plans using messages and plots a route in maps, was effectively fictitious. The demo apparently came as a surprise to members of the ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå team, who had never seen working versions of the capabilities.

The only feature from the WWDC demonstration that was activated on test devices was ‚ÄåApple Intelligence‚Äå's pulsing, colorful ribbon around the edge of the display.

Last month, Apple shook up the leadership of Siri and announced an embarrassing delay in new AI-powered features for the assistant. A behind-the-scenes look at the effort shows just how dysfunctional it got.

‚Äî‚Äî

Last June, at Apple‚Äôs annual developers conference, the company offered a dazzling demonstration of how artificial intelligence could supercharge Siri, the iPhone‚Äôs virtual assistant. But behind the scenes and in the months that followed, the Siri team couldn‚Äôt make up its mind about the basic technology needed to make it all work.

One option they considered was to build small and large language models, which they dubbed Mini Mouse and Mighty Mouse, according to a former Apple employee familiar with the effort. The small model would run on a user‚Äôs iPhone and handle simple tasks, such as setting an alarm using Siri. The large model would run in the cloud and perform more-complex chores, like automatically booking an Uber to get an iPhone user to their next meeting.

Then Siri‚Äôs leaders decided to go in a different direction and build one large model that could handle everything. That would have required running Siri‚Äôs software in the cloud, a reversal of an earlier approach when most of Siri‚Äôs software was moved on device for privacy. Other significant technical pivots followed, frustrating Siri staffers and prompting some to leave Apple. That put its goal of releasing the new Siri features this year in jeopardy.

-- The Takeaway
Apple‚Äôs decision to delay the release of new AI features in Siri came after the team behind the personal assistant struggled with technical and leadership challenges.

The indecision was among the factors contributing to Apple‚Äôs stunning announcement last month that it was, in fact, delaying the release of the new Siri features until 2026. Inside Apple, the company told staff it was also stripping responsibility for Siri from its AI chief, John Giannandrea, and his lieutenant, Robby Walker, who oversaw day-to-day operations, according to four people familiar with the matter.

In their place, Apple said its head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, would oversee Siri, with Mike Rockwell, the Apple executive who previously led development of the Vision Pro mixed reality headset, handling Walker‚Äôs former responsibilities, according to three of those people. (Bloomberg first reported the changes.)

The delay was an embarrassing setback for Apple in AI, just nine months after it had reassured investors at its developer conference that it had a plan to get its act together in AI with the Siri upgrades and other features. While Apple has long faced criticism about the plodding pace of innovation in Siri, those concerns have intensified in recent years with the explosion in popularity of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and other AI products.

Figuring out how to capitalize on AI could be one of the most consequential challenges Apple, the world‚Äôs most valuable company, is now facing‚Äîone that could determine whether the iPhone and other Apple products keep their technological edge.",biru93,1,1744473928.0

iPhone,apple,1jvzjzu,How Apple Fumbled Siri‚Äôs AI Makeover,mmr3cyt,"‚Äî Siri‚Äôs Problems

Siri‚Äôs issues started years before its recent struggles.

In 2018, when Giannandrea arrived from Google to run the newly formed AI group, his hiring was seen by the tech industry as a coup for Apple. While some executives thought Giannandrea would be more interested in overseeing the company‚Äôs self-driving‚Äìcar project‚Äîwhich it has since shelved‚Äîhe took a special interest in Siri, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

At the time, Siri, which Apple had released as a feature on iPhones in 2011, had begun to stagnate. It struggled to answer general knowledge questions and offered limited support for third-party apps.

Even before Giannandrea took control of the assistant, members of the group working on Siri felt like second-class citizens at Apple. Siri engineers were frustrated by the software engineering team‚Äôs control over iOS updates, feeling that they weren‚Äôt prioritizing fixes for Siri, according to former Apple employees with direct knowledge of the matter. The software engineers, for their part, felt the Siri team couldn‚Äôt keep up with supporting new features that came out of Federighi‚Äôs group.

Giannandrea told others he was confident he could fix Siri by adopting the playbook Google had followed to build its own AI-powered voice assistant. He believed Apple simply needed the right training data and had to get better at scraping answers from the web to answer general knowledge questions, according to a person who spoke to him about it.

In some ways, Giannandrea stood out among his colleagues at Apple. Those who have worked with him describe him as relaxed, quiet and nonconfrontational‚Äîa contrast to many other members of Apple‚Äôs executive team, some of whom were known for their demanding, type A personalities.

Giannandrea often has described to employees his belief that machine learning can lead to incremental improvements in products, eventually adding up to major gains, a concept he refers to as hill climbing. He also has expressed a dim view of chatbots in the past, telling Apple employees before and immediately after the release of ChatGPT that he didn‚Äôt believe they added much value for users.

After he joined, some of his colleagues told Giannandrea he should shake up Siri‚Äôs leadership, but he didn‚Äôt do so, according to former Apple employees who worked in the AI group.

One Siri leader often criticized by colleagues was Walker, who joined Apple in 2013 and became responsible for its daily operations at the end of 2022. In the eyes of his critics, Walker was unwilling to take big risks on Siri and focused on metrics that didn‚Äôt move the needle much on its performance, rather than having a grand vision for overhauling the voice assistant.

For instance, he often celebrated small wins such as reducing by minute percentages the delay between when someone asked Siri a question and when it responded, former Apple engineers said. Another pet Walker project was removing the ‚Äúhey‚Äù from the ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù voice command used to invoke the assistant, which took more than two years to accomplish, they said.

And last year, Walker dismissed an effort by a team of engineers to use LLMs to give Siri more emotional sensitivity so it could detect and give appropriate responses to users in distress, said a person with direct knowledge.

Walker told colleagues he wanted to focus on the next release of Siri rather than commit resources to the project. Without his knowledge, the project‚Äôs engineers bypassed him to continue working on those capabilities with the software engineering group‚Äôs safety and location team.

‚Äî Higher Pay, Faster Promotions

Over time, relations between Federighi‚Äôs software engineering group and Giannandrea‚Äôs AI team have gotten increasingly tense‚Äîand at times downright dysfunctional.

Stylistically, the two executives couldn‚Äôt be more different. Federighi‚Äôs tough and demanding management style contrasts with Giannandrea‚Äôs laid-back approach. When they are in meetings together, Federighi is known to bombard his colleagues with questions, while Giannandrea tends to do more listening, according to people who have been in meetings with them.

Other resentments also built up. Some in the software engineering group were annoyed by the higher pay and faster promotions their colleagues in the AI group were receiving. And they were bitter that some engineers in the AI group seemed to be able to take longer vacations and leave early on Fridays, while they faced more-punishing work schedules.

Distrust between the two groups got so bad that earlier this year one of Giannandrea‚Äôs deputies asked engineers to extensively document the development of a joint project so that if it failed, Federighi‚Äôs group couldn‚Äôt scapegoat the AI team.

It didn‚Äôt help the relations between the groups when Federighi began amassing his own team of hundreds of machine-learning engineers that goes by the name Intelligent Systems and is run by one of Federighi‚Äôs top deputies, Sebastien Marineau-Mes.

Over the years, Intelligent Systems has trained its own models and built demos that enabled users to control apps with voice commands, often without help from the Siri team. That created tensions with the Siri group. In one internal Apple presentation, a member of Intelligent Systems showed a slide depicting an animation of two mountains smashed together and flattened, which some saw as a subtle dig at Giannandrea‚Äôs hill-climbing philosophy, according to two people with direct knowledge.

Around 2022, the Intelligent Systems team began working with Walker and Rockwell, the executive in charge of Vision Pro, on a project code-named Link that soon went south, said four former Apple employees with direct knowledge of the project. The goal of the effort was to develop voice commands to control apps and complete tasks for the mixed reality headset and future augmented reality glasses.

Engineers who attended meetings on the three-way collaboration were struck by the open hostility of Rockwell and Marineau-Mes toward Walker, the day-to-day Siri leader. The two frequently voiced their frustration with Walker over Siri‚Äôs slow progress in supporting the Vision Pro.

For example, Rockwell wanted to allow people wearing the headset to use Siri to navigate the web and resize windows with just their voices. He also wanted two people communicating with each other in a virtual space to be able to interact with Siri together so they could, say, plan a joint vacation.

But some members of the Siri team were doubtful the team could achieve that goal. Eventually, many of the Siri features Rockwell envisioned for the Vision Pro were pared back because of the Siri team‚Äôs inability to achieve them, the people said.",biru93,1,1744474121.0
iPhone,apple,1jvzjzu,How Apple Fumbled Siri‚Äôs AI Makeover,mmr3eie,"‚Äî AI Excitement Builds

In November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT to a thunderous response from the tech industry and public. Within Giannandrea‚Äôs AI team, however, senior leaders didn‚Äôt respond with a sense of urgency, according to former engineers who were on the team at the time.

The reaction was different inside Federighi‚Äôs software engineering group. Senior leaders of the Intelligent Systems team immediately began sharing papers about LLMs and openly talking about how they could be used to improve the iPhone, said multiple former Apple employees.

Excitement began to build within the software engineering group after members of the Intelligent Systems team presented demos to Federighi showcasing what could be achieved on iPhones with AI. Using OpenAI‚Äôs models, the demos showed how AI could understand content on a user‚Äôs phone screen and enable more conversational speech for navigating apps and performing other tasks.

Former Apple employees said executives in the AI and software engineering groups scrambled to claim ownership of new features powered by LLMs. In many cases, software engineering came out on top, thanks to its strong reputation for delivering results.

Despite the company‚Äôs experimentation with OpenAI‚Äôs models, Apple managers told their engineers in 2023 they couldn‚Äôt include models from outside companies in final Apple products and could only use them to benchmark against its in-house models.

Building the large Apple models meant to compete with OpenAI was the responsibility of Giannandrea‚Äôs group. However, they didn‚Äôt perform nearly as well as OpenAI‚Äôs technology, according to multiple former Apple employees who used the models in 2023 and 2024.


‚Äî A Dubious Demo

Finally, last June Apple announced a suite of AI-powered features under the umbrella name Apple Intelligence. This suite included writing and image-generation tools, new photo-editing and mail features, and upgrades to Siri. And in a reversal of its opposition to working with AI models made by other companies, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI to offer ChatGPT as an extension for answering questions or performing tasks its own models couldn‚Äôt handle.

During an onstage demo at the conference, one Apple executive asked Siri when her mom‚Äôs flight would land. The voice assistant accessed her email and real-time flight data to provide the current arrival time. She then asked Siri to remind her about their lunch plans, and the assistant plucked the details from her iPhone‚Äôs messages and plotted a route from the airport to the restaurant.

Among members of the Siri team at Apple, though, the demonstration was a surprise. They had never seen working versions of the capabilities, according to a former Apple employee. At the time, the only new feature from the demonstration that was activated for test devices was a pulsing, colorful ribbon that appeared on the edges of the iPhone‚Äôs screen when a user invoked Siri, the former employee said.

For Apple, the Siri demo was a break from its past practice. Historically, Apple would only show features and products at its conferences that were already working on test devices and that its marketing team had vetted to ensure they could be released on time.

Still, the event impressed outsiders. Apple‚Äôs shares shot up more than 10% in the two days after announcement of the features, as Wall Street showed relief that the company had come up with an AI plan.

Some former Apple employees said they‚Äôre optimistic that Federighi and Rockwell can turn things around for Siri, given that they are typically more hands-on than Giannandrea and Walker, who have tended to rely more on their direct reports to manage things.

Federighi, for one, often knows more technical details about software projects than the junior engineers working on them. Rockwell, who joined Apple in 2015, is seen within the company as a leader with vision, who can bring fresh thinking to projects while skillfully navigating the corporate culture.

Federighi has already shaken things up. In a departure from previous policy, he has instructed Siri‚Äôs machine-learning engineers to do whatever it takes to build the best AI features, even if it means using open-source models from other companies in its software products as opposed to Apple‚Äôs own models, according to a person familiar with the matter.",biru93,2,1744474135.0

In the first year of moving to the US, I was an edgy Android warrior who did all the nerdy things like custom ROMs FOSS GrapheneOS LineageOS open source etc all that then I got the S22 Ultra which used to be my dream phone and I instantly fell in love with, since the US had a high purchasing power for phones. Later on, I hated iPhone a lot, looked down on other iPhone user teens, which I constantly made fun of. After a few years of abhorring iPhone users and iOS and constantly tweaking my Android phone‚Äôs system, I once got it bricked, but managed to fix it, then nearly my entire family had switched to iPhone from Android. Basically, I finally accepted the challenge and gave it a shot and got an iPhone 15 Pro Max.

My take on Android vs iOS is very long and specific lol but, as someone who has had an iPhone for 99% of the time I've had a smartphone (I upgraded to an HTC One M8 around a decade ago, but then switched back to iPhone within a week; my secondary Android phone I have now, I've only had for about a month), I'd say the highlights are: 

- iOS just feels much smoother/more polished than Android - there are tiny little animations or designs that I see all over Android that just make me feel like I'm using an OS from 12 years ago. 

- I don't really trust any big tech company with privacy, but Apple is definitely among the ones I ""trust"" the most - with Google being down among the ones I trust the least. 

- I'm pretty deep into the Apple ecosystem - Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Music, iMessage, iCloud Passwords, iCloud storage, Find My, etc. Sure, there's viable alternatives to all of those, but moving sounds like a hassle unless I get a VERY good reason (and there's no fully viable alternative, because part of the convenience is that the same account syncs ALL those parts of the ecosystem with each other)

- Apple is pretty reliable and predictable - I generally know what I'm getting from them, in a way I don't feel for Google or ESPECIALLY the other Android OEMs (looking at you, Samsung).

I have my frustrations with iOS (particularly around how locked down it still is, especially now that the jailbreaking scene is effectively dead), but its overall better reliability and feel still puts it above Android for me. I've also never had an issue finding apps that I want personally; the only example I can think of recently was a torrent client, though it ultimately wasn't that important as I was planning on transferring what I wanted to download to my computer anyways.

Fair enough, the ecosystem is rather important and android is just not there, because well, we are kinda decentralised opensource project, google just is the lead but yh, having to co-ordinate android and windows is hard, but for me, as a linux user, I dont have those problems (i started selfhosting and using alternatives, like having a storage server at home from an old iMac (ironic) that i use to store back ups, pictures etc etc, passwords are done by proton (privacy focused company) spotify etc etc, ecosystem is the big lacking part of android for sure, 100% apple for this one!

>Apple is pretty reliable and predictable - I generally know what I'm getting from them, in a way I don't feel for Google or ESPECIALLY the other Android OEMs (looking at you, Samsung).

this is interesting to me, having parents who have iPhones, and seeing stuff online, latest iOS/macos stuff has shown to be buggy or something? weird little stuff for sure, dont know enough to sway one way or the other.

I guess it is both down to a bit of personal preference and muscle memory/experience, using one or the other for a long time is gonna have you be more in favour of the one u use, although I dont hate iOS at all, (based in part on BSD, which is nice) I have a problem with locked down OS's that wont let me do the things I want it to do you know? my phone for me is more than just a tool to use, I like more control and so for me, android is king.

iPhone,apple,1jv47gk,Apple Dethroned by Microsoft As Top-Valued Company Amid Tariff Fears,mm75lmd,"From the article: Apple has lost its position as the world's most valuable public company to Microsoft following a dramatic four-day slide in its stock price, driven largely by concerns over President Donald Trump's escalating tariff war with China, where most of its iPhones are assembled.

Apple's market capitalization fell to $2.59 trillion as of Tuesday's close, while Microsoft now sits at $2.64 trillion, reclaiming the top spot after briefly holding it earlier this year.

Apple shares have plummeted approximately 23% over just four trading sessions, shaving $700 billion off its value, as panicked investors dump stock due to the company's exposure to China for manufacturing and sales. Apple relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing for its flagship products, making it especially vulnerable to Trump's aggressive tariff policies.

The broader market has been shaken by Trump's announcement of substantial tariffs on imports from more than 100 countries, with the Nasdaq dropping 13% over the same four-day period. However, Apple's decline has outpaced other tech companies due to its particular vulnerability to U.S.-China trade tensions.

UBS analysts have predicted that the price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max could increase by as much as $350 in the United States as a result of the tariffs. The potential price hike raises questions about how consumers might respond to significantly more expensive Apple products.

Apple has been exploring manufacturing diversification in countries like India and Vietnam in recent years, but analysts suggest it would be nearly impossible for the company to quickly shift its complex supply chain away from China. That's despite President Trump saying he ""absolutely"" believes that Apple could manufacture its iPhones and other devices in the United States. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously said that China's manufacturing expertise and scale are unmatched globally.

Both Apple and Microsoft, along with chipmaker Nvidia, had recently achieved market valuations exceeding $3 trillion before the current market turbulence began.

Microsoft appears somewhat insulated from the worst effects of the tariffs, with Jefferies analysts recently including the company among those they view as better positioned to weather the current uncertainty.

The two tech giants have traded the ""most valuable company"" title several times in recent years, with Microsoft claiming the top spot in early 2024 before Apple regained it ‚Äì only to lose it again during this week's market volatility.

According to one report, Apple earlier this week urgently requested suppliers to ship as many premium devices as possible to the U.S. by air freight before Trump's falsely-described ""reciprocal"" tariffs of 104% on China came into effect Wednesday. China has since retaliated by slapping 84% tariffs on U.S. goods.",chrisdh79,20,1744200632.0
iPhone,apple,1jv47gk,Apple Dethroned by Microsoft As Top-Valued Company Amid Tariff Fears,mmaoyu7,"Multiple things can be true at once:

* These tariffs are too damned sudden and too damned high
* The US has put itself in a very dangerous position allowing China to make everything it uses
* The US has gutted its middle- and lower-middle class by closing factories and shipping those jobs overseas
* All China-exposed companies had to know that *something* would happen sooner rather than later that would cause their manufacturing costs to soar or lose access to them entirely, and they needed to move out of China even 10 years ago
* It is incredibly hard to move out of China for manufacturing, because all the parts for your parts are also made in China, oftentimes 3 blocks away. Tim Cook has talked about this. The company that makes the little screws for iPhones is like a 10-minute drive away from where the phones are assembled. You can't beat that anywhere.

This is an incredibly difficult situation, and although Trump is a bull in a china (China?) shop, it was avoidable if American companies had thought more long-term, and more about resilience and security, and if our government had not decided 30 years ago that everyone in America either needed to be able to code or they would need to work at McDonald's, Taco Bell, and eventually deliver food with DoorDash.

iPhone,apple,1jv47gk,Apple Dethroned by Microsoft As Top-Valued Company Amid Tariff Fears,mm89mlt,"Stocks are drive a LOT more by perception than reality. Stocks go up when people THINK the company is doing well (sure, there are reality driven things like earning calls that affect stock prices, but those are usually ""corrections"" to the perception. People buy stock before the earning calls, before product announcements, etc. based on what they PERCEIVE is going to happen, then correct if their perception is changed by reality).

To your point about Apple, I'd say they are equal parts hardware and software at this point. But if we're picking one to say what they are ""at heart"", I'd actually say they are, at their heart, a software company. Remember there was a small period of time where they licensed Mac OS to run on non-Apple made hardware, which if they were a hardware company at heart, they likely wouldn't have done. Most of their stuff around hardware has been because they realized to create the best software, you have to tightly control the hardware.

Drivers are probably the number one cause of issues on Windows. Drivers exist because you can't bake the hardware/software interaction layers into the OS if your OS needs to be able to support third party devices. If you only support specific hardware, you don't really need to support drivers. (I'm simplifying this a lot, I know there's a lot packed into ""hardware/software interaction layers"", but the details are irrelevant to the point). Prior to designing their own hardware, they would just select specific hardware from other companies and only support that hardware and bake those things into their OS.

The reason Apple is hit harder by this is because of this exact perception that you stated. Both Microsoft and Apple are hardware and software companies (Microsoft has Azure cloud hardware, Surface line of products, Xbox, even things like Holo Lens and stuff). But when people thing of Microsoft, they think of Windows and Office. Mostly the software. When people think of Apple, they think of iPhone and Mac. Mostly the hardware.

So if tariffs are going to affect your stock price, the company that people think of the hardware first is the company that is going to be hit hardest, even if Apple at it's heart is a software company.

Because of the Azure hardware infrastructure, and the surface line, and the Xbox, Microsoft is likely to be hit REALLY hard by the tariffs as well (one could argue even harder as the impact will be less up-front, meaning people are less likely to associate cost increases with tariffs and get pissed at Microsoft instead of who is actually to blame). But because people don't perceive them as a hardware company as much as Apple, people are not dumping their stock as much as they are dumping Apple's.",Drim498,-1,1744213591.0

Americans certainly *say* they want manufacturing jobs re-shored, and have voted accordingly in two of the last three elections.

They also say they want jobs that don‚Äôt require a four year degree, and hand-wave about ‚Äútrades‚Äù, etc.

But then if you talk to people in skilled labor ¬†they have trouble finding qualified people to meet demand - and it‚Äôs harder as the skill set required gets more refined. So maybe carpenters are a little easier to find, but we don‚Äôt have nearly enough people going into HVAC install and repair.

In this instance re: China and iPhones, Apple (at least Cook) has been open about the fact that China doesn‚Äôt only have this market of high-precision electronics manufacturing cornered because of low wages *but because of the skill set required*. And when you look into other work that is done in the states, like machinists, you‚Äôll find them saying basically the same thing: that younger people are not going in to these fields and that we cannot support the needs of production with the labor force we have.

And so my question is, what the hell is going on here?

It feels to me that it‚Äôs obvious that a lot of the talk about blue collar jobs in the US is just bullshit. Politicians are full of shit, most having never worked a real job other than ‚Äúlawyer‚Äù in the first place; but a sizable chunk of the voting population appears to agree with them, and yet *we can‚Äôt even fill the manufacturing jobs we have now*.

You already touched on the labor pool but along with the lack of available workers (which already makes it impossible), you'd have to pay them more if you could even find enough. That's not including all of the training that will be done on a regular basis. 

The tooling is not something they just special order from a catalog. It's highly specialized and is incredibly expensive. Speaking of airplanes, there have been companies in the US that have gone to the manufacturers of plane parts to get their own products produced and they've been told repeatedly that they have to look elsewhere, mostly because of tooling issues. The time and cost to setup factories (not workers) would be extremely prohibitive. 

Then you have raw materials. Remember, the tariffs are not for certain industries, they're for entire countries and the US does not produce all of the materials required for its products. Sourcing also becomes difficult since they'd no longer be manufacturing in places like China and they wouldn't be given priority like they have been for all these years.

It‚Äôs true that the US and other western nations have been trying to move key sectors out of China for years now, hence the tariffs on things like EVs and batteries, but with blanket tariffs across the board, it has become impossible to do any manufacturing in the US. If you wanted to produce an iPhone in America you‚Äôd need to import batteries, titanium, PCBs/SMDs, OLED panels, etc. Almost none of the inputs needed for an iPhone are made in America, and you can‚Äôt just import a whole supply chain at once, so each individual part would be subject to tariffs. You would also run into the same problem as you go down the supply chain and realize that most of the inputs for those parts are also going to be subject to tariffs. With the current tariff system it would actually be cheaper to just continue making Chinese phones and pay the tariffs than it would be to try manufacturing in America.

If you actually wanted to move iPhone production to the west, you‚Äôd need a carefully formulated plan of incentives and targeted tariffs coordinated between all of the west and our Asian allies to create an incentive structure for Apple to begin the process of investing in production in a western country. Without some kind of incentive like a Chips Act, realistically Apple will only ever go to the next lowest cost place (India, Vietnam, Cambodia, etc.)

Although really this is a non-issue. No one believes there‚Äôs a real strategic risk of losing smartphone manufacturing when it‚Äôs being done in other nations like India and South Korea.

The US is not like any of those countries. Their locations are well positioned in the supply chain networks. They already had manufacturing infrastructure in place and it's still developing (lookup how long it took them to get where they are). Lower labor costs and government subsidies help offset tooling costs but they still have to deal with a lack of tooling expertise, which is mostly concentrated in China.

Yes, but tariffs are going to end up increasing prices globally, although primarily the impact will be on this country.

>At least people who live close the Canadian or Mexican border can just drive over the border and get the regular prices one.

Yes, but legally you'll be subject to a duty.  The first $800 would be exempt. If you're traveling with family it could be up to $3,200 if pooled together. The duty is also only 3% for the next $1,000 after that (after that it gets tricky based on classification).

So a $1,800 iPhone would have no duty if you pooled it with spouse/family, or if by yourself, it would only be a $30 duty.

The above assumes you've been in that country for 48 hours or more. Less than that and the per person exemption is $200.

>Also, what happened to California‚Äôs independent tariff negotiations? Can blue states just band together and say they‚Äôre not on board with this nonsense?

What Newsom is trying to do is negotiate on the tariffs other countries would place on imports from California.  This is something that he, a virtually anyone else, has the legal ability to do, but with less leverage since tariff reciprocity is dependent on the federal government.  So it may be something like, ""Hey China, if you don't tax the wine coming from California, we'll give you tax breaks on the state taxes you may be paying on operations within California"".

I am a mini zealot. I have rode the original iPhone SE in the recycled 5s casing into the sunset until the 12 mini came out. I now have the 13 mini, I have a spare unopened 13 mini. I have tried & mildly enjoyed bigger phones for ""premium features"" and eventually moved back to the mini because nothing since the 12/13 minis release has really felt like a gotta have. Maybe usb-c but im willing to live without that for the form factor.

The clamshell fold isn't it for me. I've held and played with the android ones.

Can't speak for all mini enjoyers but the allure of the mini for me and where the advent of the 12mini finally moved small phone into fully-capable phone territory is the blend of convenient utility with all the bells and whistles. The convenience for me is absolutely derived from the size of the phone, it's one I enjoy using and brings me joy. It's one where if I want to i can still watch youtube vids n stuff but generally even the biggest phone sucks at this experience, and I just use my desktop or tv to watch stuff. Like the biggest phone screen is still a tiny portable screen that is way smaller than an ipad screen and that's just not very great for any media consumption. I don't see the difference between an iphone mini and a maytag refrigerator sized iphone 42069 giga pro max in terms of a media consumption experience at all, it feels the same to me (its a small screen that fits in your pocket). When people say bigger screen for watching stuff, it's just not a justification that resonates with me and I've tried all the phone sizes. 

Pocketability, surprisingly, isn't the biggest thing i care about with iphone sizes. They are all sized to fit inside someones pocket. With that said, the clam fold phones just don't offer anything special to me I actually think their pocketability sucks. More importantly there's just no way they're going to provide a ""mini"" form factor when opened, and in a folded state it's really not going to be small. In it's folded state, the proper phone resolutions sort of just warrant a device that turns into a square brick that is just an awkward size with double thickness when folded.They'll for big/regular phone sizes once open. So unless they make something with the current iphone mini dimensions when open, i probably wont care too much. 

And if im gonna commit to jumping ship to a big phone knowing that, give me the book mode. At least i gain a shit ton of utility by ceding to the big-phone gods by also having what effectively is a whole ass tablet. If you're gonna go big, go all the way. Clamshells to date have been pointless for me & i highly doubt apple is going to try and actually strive for small form factors with a clamshell. It'll probably be regular iphone sized but folded. Clam fold feels like a party trick that's cool for like maybe 5 seconds.",anchoricex,2,1744057532.0

The IPT said in a written ruling that it had refused the British government's application that ""the bare details of the case"", including that it was brought by Apple, be kept private.

Apple and Britain's Home Office, its interior ministry, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Washington Post reported in February that Britain had issued a ""technical capability notice"" to Apple to enable access to encrypted messages and photos, even for users outside the country.

Apple has long said that it would never build a so-called backdoor into its encrypted services or devices, because once one is created, it could be exploited by hackers in addition to governments, a sentiment echoed by security experts.

iPhone,apple,1jti65o,Apple Might Delay Its Rumored New Smart Home Hub Until Next Year,mlubvn7,"From the article: Apple's rumored new smart home hub command center that was expected this year could be delayed, pushing its release all the way to 2026, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.

In his latest Power On [newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-06/will-apple-raise-iphone-prices-in-the-us-after-trump-tariffs-iphone-17-details), Gurman revealed that Apple is ""considering a delay until 2026"" for the new smart home device. The main reason for the potential postponement is reportedly tied to ""major engineering hiccups"" with the revamped Siri voice assistant that will power the device.

Initially, Apple had hoped to release the product by now, and there were reports suggesting it might still arrive around the time of this year's iPhone 17 series launch in September. Now, those plans appear to be in jeopardy.

""The major engineering hiccups related to the revamped Siri voice assistant ended up delaying the product,"" Gurman wrote. ""No big surprise there: The device will be primarily controlled by voice, and it depends on Siri and the underlying App Intents technology.""

Despite the delay, testing of the device ‚Äì code-named J490 ‚Äì continues at Apple headquarters. A large number of employees are also reportedly testing the hub in their homes.

Gurman compared the upcoming product to the Google Nest Hub, suggesting it won't ""make a big difference in terms of revenue"" for Apple. However, he noted that it could set the stage for more ambitious products in the future.

I have a running bet with one of my direct co-workers that the prices will for sure go up (Apple COULD eat the cost, but Tim Cook will never do that, he is only about profit anymore)... But that at the launch of the iPhone 17 they'll tweak things slightly.

My bet is that during the keynote, per usual, they'll list off all of the things the phone is great on and how wonderful and magical it is BUT at the very end instead of announcing the price (again it's the smart strategy of show the people everything the product can do and then show the price to hopefully offset their fears), I have a STRONG feeling they just simply won't show the price in their official keynote, and then within minutes of the keynote ending the Internet will find out the actual price, I'm for sure thinking over $2,300, and it'll spread like wildfire online.

That estimate also doesn't factor in that 2/3rds of the people buying iPhones are actually outside of the US.

A $1,599 retail iPhone costs around 700 dollars to make. The 54% tariff will add $380 to Apple‚Äôs cost. If Apple push all the cost to consumers, the price will be $1,979. There will be numerous tax deductions associated with the tariff paid by the importer, and the manufacturers will have to reduce prices they charge to remain competitive. The host country (China) will likely give subsidies to keep the export business going and Apple will likely reduce profit margin to offset some price increases.

iPhone,apple,1jrgmvl,"iPhones Could Cost Up to $2,300 in the U.S. Due to Tariffs, Analyst Says",mlevzu7,"It's not impossible but it makes a lot of assumptions.

The retail price of a product is not its import value, and products at different price points have different margins.

If you are selling imported widgets for $100 which you buy for $60, a 50% tariff means you pay a $30 tax on each widget.  If you pass that on to consumers, now they pay $130 which is a 30% increase in retail price.  Your profit margin goes down but your earnings (or EPS for a public company) are the same as long as your customers can afford the tariff.

In order to get the worst case outcome that makes for a good headline, here's one way to do it:  Take Apple's net profit margin of 24% assume this applies directly and uniformly to all of its products and that Apple has no other costs globally other than buying products to import.  That would cause you to conclude that an iPhone sold for $1599 cost $1599 * .76 = $1,215.24 to import, then apply a 54% tariff to that and get $656.23, add that to the retail price and get $2255 which is a 41% increase.  Then round that up to $2300 because Apple typically uses prices which are $XX99 in that range.

This is shaky because Apple does have a lot of other costs which are not importing products so the 24% net profit margin does not apply directly to products.  High end iPhones have the highest margins which probably exceed 40% so passing a 54% tariff directly on to customers would be a 21.6% price increase, probably more with rounding.

Another way to argue for a $2300 phone is to assume that Apple's high end customers can easily afford to spend more while its low end customers cannot, and so it will pass on the tariff costs disproportionally to these two groups - increase the high end products by a lot more and don't increase the low end products enough to cover the tariff completely.  This route is more plausible, however it also means that you can't apply the 43% to both the high end AND the low end retail prices which the article does.",Worf_Of_Wall_St,1,1743789974.0

2. You can get raw accelerometer and gyroscope data, 100hz frequency is kind of enough, depends on how it works inside (I suspect actual hardware has higher probe frequency and then have some SW which processes it).

iPhone,apple,1jqh2bj,iPhone 17 Pro: New 48MP Telephoto Lens May Change How Zoom Works,ml6tmhi,"From the article: Apple is reportedly planning a major upgrade to the Telephoto camera in the iPhone 17 Pro, and while it may seem like a step back on paper, the change could actually improve real-world usability, if one leaker's claims are anything to go by.

According to [Majin Bu](https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-pro-revolution-in-mobile-photography-with-advanced-telephoto-lens/), the iPhone 17 Pro will feature a new Telephoto lens with a 48MP sensor, up from the current 12MP sensor found in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. This rumor isn't new ‚Äì in fact it's been repeatedly claimed by several other sources. However, Bu goes further by claiming that the new lens will offer 3.5x optical zoom (85mm equivalent) instead of the 5x zoom (120mm equivalent) currently available.

This focal length is generally better suited for portraits and everyday photography, since it allows users to frame shots without having to move as far away from the subject. However, the big shift allegedly comes from the new 48MP sensor, in that the extra resolution allows for digital cropping to simulate longer focal lengths, offering less quality loss than normal digital zoom.

This is similar to what Apple already does with the main Fusion camera on the iPhone 16, where the 48MP sensor enables a 2x digital crop ‚Äì marketed as ""Telephoto"" ‚Äì that still produces a 12MP image with minimal quality loss.

Bu points out that one of the practical benefits of a 3.5x telephoto lens would be greater versatility, especially for portrait photography. A 3.5x lens would make it easier to compose portraits at more comfortable distances, particularly in indoors or other tight environments.

The alleged change would see Apple relying more on high-resolution sensors and computational processing to replace some of the limitations of traditional optics. If the report is accurate, the iPhone 17 Pro could deliver more flexible zoom options while making portrait photography more user-friendly, without sacrificing image quality.

Given that the iPhone 16 Pro models already have 48MP Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could be the first iPhone models to boast a rear triple-camera array made up entirely of 48-megapixel lenses. Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 lineup in September.",chrisdh79,74,1743683199.0

iPhone,apple,1jqh2bj,iPhone 17 Pro: New 48MP Telephoto Lens May Change How Zoom Works,mlarjgm,"Except that the lens won't naturally create the effect anyway, because it'll still have something like an f/8-11 equivalent aperture (depending on the exact setup they use, maybe f/7) unless Apple dramatically change that to make it EXCLUSIVELY a portrait lens, and even then I'm not convinced there's enough space to put a 4x larger aperture on that lens

And if they did that it wouldn't be useable for anything else whatsoever, it would be a portrait lens ONLY

Which is to say, you're going to end up with software blur anyway - because I really don't see Apple turning that whole lens into a portrait lens and making the aperture 4x larger at huge cost

That's what I mean about this article, it's talking about an 85mm lens being a ""portrait"" lens and how that's going to be better... completely ignoring all the other factors (particularly aperture) that come into that equation. A 85mm f/1.8 lens is a portrait lens. An 85mm f/8 (equivalent) is REALLY not

At best you'd bring the physical lens and aperture down a stop, but you're still doing 90% of the work with software which is going to give a very similar result to just doing it 100% in software

And in exchange you're giving up a surprising amount of zoom or resolution. I think people sometimes underestimate the value of focal length reach. [This isn't perfect but gives a good idea of what you'd be losing](https://i.imgur.com/dHccfpN.png). 85mm is exactly what you'd end up with, with a current iPhone being pretty much halfway between the other two.

And if we can't physically fit a bigger aperture, I see no reason to give up reach. The longest focal length lens should always be as long as they can manage with the engineering available, because there's no way to substitute that

I mean, why not just put a 50mm lens in and use your digital crop there, if you're fine with a digital crop? It makes much more sense to mess around with the middle lenses and leave the widest and longest lenses alone

The biggest weakness of an iPhone (and the main reason it doesn't replace my ""proper"" camera) is the fact that I'm limited to 50/85/120mm (depending on the exact model) equivalent. Whereas my longest lens gets out to 480mm equivalent (APS-C so it's a 300mm on a 1.6x crop factor sensor)

I'd like to see the iPhone Pro having 4 lenses, personally. Stretch a 4th lens out to 200mm and sure, maybe there's enough wriggle room to pull the 120mm back to 85mm. But making the longest lens shorter is just crazy to me - there's SO much more value in a longer lens rather than tinkering with having to step forward/backwards a couple of steps or having marginally more bokeh while still leaving 90% of it in software.

Yeah man, this isn't how international business units work. Apple, for one, has zero incentive to basically subsidize US prices when they already dominate the market here, and competitors are subject to the same tariff pressures. **And Apple's earnings overseas are stuck there** unless they want to pay **major** taxes on relocating them to the USA.

iPhones are more expensive in Europe because of exchange rates, VAT, regulatory requirements, and yes -- EU issued tariffs, duties, and import fees. Some manufacturers are willing to eat the cost and reduce margins. Apple, historically, does not. The same is true in the US, where prices prove remarkably sticky even as their costs arguably drive down.

People need to remember that nearly *everything* business ops related is more expensive in the EU than the US. That includes *what happens to the money after it is collected.* Apple would love nothing more than to be able to send all those European earnings back into the US without a major tax hit by Uncle Sam.

Under the current (presumably old) Buttons work using a sensor that detects the button is PHYSICALLY pushed down. The haptic buttons would never move, because they can‚Äôt and instead the physical pressure on the NOT moving button is being detected. That is the difference.

And hence it would make zero difference with gloves or a case.

The name haptic comes from the feedback you will get because a vibration motor will simulate the feeling of a click.

If your phone doesn't activate in your pocket today, these new buttons shouldn't change that.

I like real buttons, especially in cars and laptops where you don't wanna look at where you are pressing. On a phone I don't see that much benefit of having physical buttons. I also don't see much benefit of not having them, other than if the whole side of the phone if ""force sensitive"" and you can choose where and how many buttons you want.

iPhone,apple,1jptcc1,Apple Hit With $5 Billion Class Action Lawsuit Over eBooks Availability,ml1tujx,">A lawsuit filed against Apple in California this week accuses the company of violating the state's false advertising law and other consumer laws, by intentionally misleading customers into thinking that they are purchasing digital e-books from the Apple Books app in perpetuity, when instead they are only purchasing revokable licenses to the books.

>The proposed class action complaint explains that Apple is required to pull a digital book or audiobook from the Apple Books app if and when it loses a license to that content, resulting in the content no longer being available in the app's store. As a result, the complaint alleges that some customers have unexpectedly found that digital books they previously purchased were no longer available to re-download, despite having paid for them. Apple removes books without warning, and without providing refunds, the complaint adds.

>As noted in the complaint, the purchase screen in the Apple Books app does not include a link to any terms of service or licensing information. However, in order to set up and use an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or other Apple device, users are required to agree to Apple's various software license agreements, which all state the following:

>""By using this software in connection with an Apple Account, or other Apple Services, you agree to the applicable terms of service, such as the latest Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions [‚Ä¶]""

>In the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, Apple states the following:

>""Purchased Content will generally remain available for you to download, redownload, or otherwise access from Apple. Though it is unlikely, subsequent to your purchase, Content may be removed from the Services and become unavailable for further download or access from Apple (for instance, because Apple loses its right from the Content provider to make it available). To ensure your ability to continue enjoying Content, we encourage you to download all purchased Content to a device in your possession and to back it up.""

>The lawsuit, Morehouse et al v. Apple, Inc., was filed in a U.S. district court in San Jose on Tuesday. The plaintiffs are seeking up to $5 billion in damages, with the proposed class being all individuals who purchased a digital book or audiobook from the Apple Books store within the to-be-determined class period. A judge has yet to be assigned to the case, and it remains to be seen if the class action lawsuit is certified and proceeds to trial.

Apple officially announced the new feature support for AirPods Max last week. Then on Monday, Apple released an AirPods Max (USB-C) firmware update version 7E99 in tandem with the rollout of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 software updates for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, since then, AirPods Max owners have not been able to successfully update their devices due to an unspecified conflict with the firmware and Apple‚Äôs latest software.

The AirPods Max firmware was supposed to enable lossless and low-latency audio support as part of the broader software releases. ‚ÄúWith this update, AirPods Max will unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio, preserving the integrity of original recordings and allowing listeners to experience music the way the artist created it in the studio,‚Äù said Apple in a press release. ‚ÄúLossless audio and ultra-low latency audio enable music creators to fully utilize AirPods Max throughout their entire professional workflow on Logic Pro and other music creation apps.‚Äù

However, after Apple indicated the firmware was available for download, user reports of problems slowly began to trickle in. As it stands, there‚Äôs no sign that anyone has been able to install the firmware.

It‚Äôs still not clear what Apple has done in iOS/iPadOS 18.4 and macOS Sequoia 15.4 to cause the issue, but all the indications are that Apple will need to release a point update to its platforms to correct the bug. On its AirPods firmware support page, Apple currently lists the unobtainable firmware version 7E99 for AirPods Max as ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù",chrisdh79,59,1743594424.0

They don't support lossless when connected to any other device. Source is [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111834). You can see that they only talk about lossless audio when connected to Vision Pro.

And for the resistance rating, the APP2 (Lightning) are IPX4, while the APP2 (USB-C) are IP54.

The only difference between those two is that the ""X"" in IPX4 just means the dust resistance wasn't tested. That doesn't mean ""worse"" to be clear - it means ""unknown"" or ""not tested"".

Given that they didn't change the case or the buds size/shape at all and the Lightning and USB-C versions are fully intercompatible (and I even use Lightning APP2 buds in a USB-C APP2 case), I'd be willing to bet money that it's the exact same case and buds but they actually put it through dust ingress testing certification this time to give it something ""new"" over the last version.

Firstly the brands I have used are Samsung, iPhone, Google, Huawei, Xiaomi, Motorola, and Nokia.

Brands I am looking to try next Oneplus, Honor, and Sony.

This applies to the flagships not necessarily to all their devices and also to me personally.

1. They offer the most versatile and rounded option while it might not shine in a single department one can experience close to it in all the departments.
The cameras might not be as good as the Chinese brands but they are good also all the lenses give good results including selfies and ultrawide, and similarly, the charging won't be as fast but faster than Google and iPhone. 
2. The UI is better than all of the others I have used so far
3. Battery optimization is better than most others. 
4. Routines (Only Apple has modes but even those are not as flexible and useful)
5. Highest customization on any device I have seen.
6. Samsung DEX and S-Pen. S-Pen is limited to the Ultra only tho.

These are a few although there are more as well.
As far as the F7 Ultra and S25 are concerned.
F7 Ultra isn't exactly a flagship.",BL4Z3_001,1,1744736437.0

A lot of these new hyper spec phones are great, but they have 2 or 3 years updates, they often have more bloatware so they can subsidise some of the cost to advertising partners. The bloatware issue isnt the same across the globe or with all samsung products, in some territories there are more apps pre installed to allow the device to be sold at a lower price.  In the S range you get no bloatware, just the samsung apps and google apps, anything else is due to the region or specific carrier. A range have more pre installed apps but are significantly cheaper. The UK no longer sell any other ranges, but I know the M range is specific to Asia and Europe is designed to be affordable and will have bloatware to help achieve that. 

Smaller brands rely on people who upgrade often so they don't have a phone long enough to really know that the phone stops getting updates at 3 years. 

There are other factors for things like OS and android updates being slow, they have to be stable before release. and there is also a factor that with the AI features that come with one ui 7 there is an issue with the google servers being over subscribed if there are suddenly all those extra devices being added at once through the update.",nabnabking,1,1744738837.0

I had been using the Samsung Galaxy A71 that I got close to half off about five years ago on prime day. It was a great phone for what I paid for it and it didn't everything I needed. But I recently realized it wasn't getting any more security updates (How important those are is open for debate) and the battery wasn't what it once was.

So about a week or two ago when Amazon was having their Big Spring Sale, I started keeping my eye out for deals. I eventually saw that the best deal I could get without trading in or paying in cash was to buy it directly from Samsung. At first I thought about getting the S25 but when I saw it was smaller than my current phone I was going to get the S25+. But Samsung was offering $200 off the S25 Ultra and only $125 off the S+. And when I saw that I could make interest free payments through my TMobile plan, I broke down and bought the Ultra!

Now while I'm not sure this phone is ""worth"" the ~$1,400 it costs post tax with no discount... But I do have to admit, this phone is amazing. 

Again, I've been using a mid-range phone so I don't know if it's just great by comparison or on its own but I've never used any device that is so smooth, quick and responsive. Everything you do is instant and immediate. It's blazing fast. The screen is amazing as well.

Vivo x200 pro. This is the very first Android phone where it optimize everything itself just like iPhone(Which I truly like about). I don't want spend flagship level money on phones & do this/do that for better, this phone handled perfectly. Like I charge it with every 24 or so. Of which 2-3hr is gaming somewhat, rest camera/social media/music. Gives me around 8hr or so SOT in general l, could go up if I do some settings but idc. Everything left on max or the way it was,nothing compromised.

Camera ? This is the best. No kidding, you will notice an huge difference even from iPhone. I won't go into specs much but it defines what actual camera is. Check reviews. Are they any better ? Personal preference of people taste but this phone comes in top camera category along few other.

OS wise, For me it's very clean & smooth. I was in One UI 6 & honestly I don't know what's the hype ?. I don't care about customization much besides choosing my personal wallpaper for appealing. OS provides all functions that I can think of & has not encounterd any issues. So for me, it's really fine.

It also provides 4 yrs of OS support & 5 yrs security. For me it's totally good. Besides 4 yrs seems decent & you can stretch it even beyond until the phones last breath unless you encounterd problems/tempted to buy new phone.

This phone has two versions Chinese with Origin OS & Global with Funtouch OS. People say Chinese version a bit better but honestly after checking everything its only missing few shenanigans here & there & not worth that Chinese bloat ware. I bought the global & extremely good experience so far. That pretty much sums it all I guess.

I don't give a damn about brand loyalty so I choose where the leading & interesting innovating technology is, brands other than iPhone & Samsung has finally taken the lead. If you are flexible for other brand, check it's review throughly.",bdragoo3,4,1744663253.0

Xiaomi used to be profitable as it was cheap then those bugs in the OS could be forgiven, now as the phone costs as much as an iphone or Samsung and the OS is still a hole with bugs then nothing but to laugh about it.

What kind of permissions? Accessibility for example can stop working just like that.

Samsung,smartphones,1jz7k03,Please help me decide on a phone,mn4fzqx,"Samsung unfortunately became possibly the worst Android in the industry. 

1. Due to the extreme demand of galaxy series due to their excellent phones in the past, they couldnt manage new sic batteries, hence battery capacity of the Samsung phones is criminal by todays standards, S25 has literally 4000 mah (S25 Ultra has 5000, 20% lower capacity than say OnePlus 13 which has 6000). 

2. Also they dont provide IP69 rating, and while you wont wash your phone in dishwasher, its a testament to better build quality and lower manufacturing tolerances. 

3. Charging is also within the very slowest in the industry, S25 has 25W charging speed, in reality it takes literally over two times longer to charge it than OnePlus.  

4. While having Snapdragon 8 Elite too, Samsung phones, including Ultra model have possibly the worst stability in the industry, type ""OnePlus 13 vs Samsung S25 Ultra vs Honor Grid Autosport gaming test"" - Samsung is the worst performing. 

5. Display: while they were the best in the industry couple of iterations ago, they got destroyed by competition. Samsung still has only 8 bit display, incabale of producing HDR image natively, but achieves that trough FRC, and there isnt even DV support at all, also PMW dimming is the worst in the industry, making it less healthy for the eyes, and even creating feelable strain for many, also their displays are within the dimmest around. S25 Ultra model has anti-reflective glass that helps with that, but S25 doesnt. 


As for Oppo, its a good phone, but same points as for OnePlus vs Vivo - OnePlus wins. Its more comprable to X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro. Also OnePlus has physically larger screen which is always huge benefit for games.",Toymachina,1,1744662931.0

16 pro max. If you want a camera that is ready to go at all times I feel like this is a great option. And with 18.4 update, supposedly battery issues are gone.",solidgun1,0,1744616076.0

iPhone,smartphones,1jymywj,Thinking of switching to Samsung or Google pixel,mmzxnf6,"I was always an android user and switched to an iPhone 13 pro when it came out. 2 weeks ago I switched back to a pixel. 

Here's my experience, and I'll preface with saying that I don't plan on going back to an iPhone. 

Apps work better on iPhone. It's not androids fault, it's just that it's easier to app developers to focus on iPhone and have half the market covered. There are so many different android phones that it's more work to make sure they're all bug free. That's not to say they don't work, you'll just likely see minor issues here and there on random apps. It doesn't make them unusable, just a little annoying is all. 

iMessage - if it's a big deal to you, get ready. Rcs works great, but it's not iMessage. It's good enough, but still not iMessage. 

Camera - I can't tell a difference. I honestly feel like most cameras are good enough for the average user these days. See mkbhd videos where he does an annual bracket competition thing. Most people can't tell the difference either. 

Airpods & pixel buds - again, airpods are better, but most people can't tell the difference. Maybe if you use them back to back, but it's not like the pixel buds are trash. I'd say the pixel buds are great, and the airpods are really great. 

Find my - again, Apple wins here. I don't know why, I've seen other people explain it. I just know it's not as good. You can now see friends on the android find my app, but it's still not as good as apples. 

Customization - android wins without a doubt. So many different ways to customize things. 

Accessories - again Apple. It's a numbers thing, there are just more iPhones out there than each individual android phone. So less choices for cases and what not. HOWEVER!!!! you have more choices when it comes to things like earbuds, watches, etc. You're notnlocked into the Apple ecosystem, so you can get whatever you like. 

Keyboard - thank God I'll never have to use the iPhone keyboard again! And changing keyboards on iPhone is not the same. They lock down too many features to make them all just about as bad as theirs. 

Android - Screen is better. Bluetooth is better (could just be cause it's newer). Wi-Fi is better (again, maybe just cause it's newer). Love USB c charging speeds. LOVE not being locked into apples ecosystem and their way of doing things. Notifications are better. Settings are better. File management is better. Tethering to a Chromebook is great. Yea, Apple might do some things better than android, but it wasn't enough to stay locked into their way of doing things.

*** This is just my opinion. Many will disagree. I don't think one is better than the other overall, it comes down mainly to preference IMO. If you're already on a MacBook and have all the Apple accessories, it's probably not worth switching.",Crue87,18,1744597008.0

If you have to restore, you will lose these if you did not manually save each one to the phone photo library. iOS does a complete restore of everything. so, i feel safer in iOS. Also, iOS gives faster software updates than Samsung. Google, I just cannot trust with hardware anymore.

I have always been an Android user, I have tried iPhone, Samsung, Pixel, Huawei, Motorola, Nokia, and Xiaomi. 
I keep ending back on Samsung so far but I have yet to try Oneplus, Honor, Sony, and Asus so those are next on my list.

Samsung is a very safe bet for most people, it does almost everything just right and is extremely reliable and versatile but that does sometimes make it boring. Lately, they haven't made many improvements similar to the iPhone so if you want something with new features or the latest design better to go for Chinese options.

Pixel is great in terms of a Clean Android experience personally I find that much more boring compared to the Samsung, then there is the camera which is great for point-and-click but lacks manual controls, none of that is a deal breaker tho the deal breaker for me is the extremely slow charging and terrible battery especially ever since the Tensor it is improved now but still falls behind compared to the rest and also worse performance of the bunch and by far.

Both should take decent pictures but have inferior hardware compared to flagships from the same brands. In video recording iPhone should win hands down.

Pixel has 120 Hz screen, iPhone is at 60 Hz; some people won't care, dealbreaker for others.

iPhone has much better processor, which combined with the lower refresh rate means it should feel much faster than the Pixel once 4-5 years have elapsed.

The iPhone is smaller, thinner and lighter but it would be best to check out a unit at a store to judge if it's a difference you'd feel day to day. It should also feel more premium, Apple has decades of design experience prior to Google and much higher sales volume, they know how to make a phone feel appealing.

The 9a is also worth checking out, it's an upgrade from the 8a overall, except for it has a smaller camera sensor (but also almost no camera bump) which may impact quality.

Don't forget the biggest differentiator which is OS. Do your research on features you care about and respective availability. If there's any that come to mind share them and I can try to give an answer too.",Tzankotz,1,1744642945.0

HTC one - died and it can only go in some kind of infinite reset loop and nothing else.


OnePlus Nord 1 - still works and no scratch. But it slowed down soo i use it sometimes for YouTube, movies, shows and thats it. 




All others i gave or they just died completely. Iam just surprised how my old iPhone from 2007 still works. I mean its not of any use today because it have 8GB of memory space which is nothing for today standards, but back in the days it was something.",larini_vjetrovi,1,1744557326.0

Avoid S24 unless you are importing the snapdragon variant because I have never had good experience with Exynos chips. They heat up more, use more battery, their modems are always inferior to the snapdragon variant of the phone. But Samsung does have a good repair experience from what I've heard.

I'd also put Google's phones in the same category as the Exynos S24 because Tensor chip is just a rehashed Exynos with Google magic solely going towards on-device AI, the cameras, and the software.

Now you said that phones have OS support of 2 years for low end and 3-5 years on high end phones or flagship ones. This was true before, but now things changed. Some budget phones for example budget Samsung phones went to the 7 years of OS support. iPhone on another hand also have many years of support, for example iPhone 11 still have OS support and it will get next iOS.



Now this root acces is also true, but this is now the case with more or less every device from phones, consoles to the PC. You just can‚Äôt go without it. Its just the way it is now and you can chose to go with it or without tech at all.



I agree that all of them have similar look and that there is no creativity any more. But phones went to that point where they are making the product for the mass usage and they are looking to make the device that is for everyone or at least for most users as possible. 


Last thing where i agree is the price. Its true that phones are expensive. Also new ones are coming out every year which is kinda stupid to me because i dont see some changes they can make in one year. They could do it in 2-3 years, but in one there is just not enough time to publish the device that will make me to buy the next one. But as much they are expensive they became really powerfull computers with the time. I mean the least thing we are using phones now are the things that phone is made for and this is pure offline calling and messages.




I mean Iam not someone who love smartphones, but they just because something that Iam using every day.
